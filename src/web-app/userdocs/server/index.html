<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The FEDORA acronym stands for Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository 
  Architecture. The Fedora server is an implementation of the Fedora architecture 
  that provides a general purpose digital object repository system for storing, 
  managing, and delivering digital content.</p>

<p><b>Access Control and Authentication</b></p>
<p>Although Access Control is not slated until year two of the project, the implementation 
  of a simple form of access control has been added to provide a minimal level 
  of security. IP range restriction is supported at both the Management API and 
  the Access API exposures. The fedora.fcfg configuration file contains two new 
  optional parameters in the Access and Management Modules named &quot;allowhosts&quot; 
  and &quot;denyhost&quot; that are used to provide a comma delimited set of IP 
  ranges. By default, the Management API is restricted to the IP address of the 
  local host and the Access API is unrestricted. In addition, basic authentication 
  is supported for API-M client-to-server communication. The client scripts and 
  fedora-admin GUI have been modified to take a username and password at startup. 
  Only one user, the super user &quot;fedoraAdmin&quot;, is supported at this 
  time. The password for fedoraAdmin is configured in fedora.fcfg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Server Port Configuration</b></p>
<p>Server administrators can now more easily configure the port on which the Fedora 
  server is exposed. The port is set in fedora.fcfg. Its default is 8080.</p>
