    [talk about plug-in api]
    <br><br>
    The plug-ins are distributed as .class files in the <code>plugins</code>
    package.  They're checked before performing an action... there is a hook
    before each action.  You can continue with the default action or not,
    and you have access to a few things that let you interact with the system,
    etc, etc.
    <br><br>
    There will probably be two types of plug-ins.  One is an action thing...
    before/after an action, and the other is a thing added to the tools
    menu.  The plugin interface should provide some method for getting
    the name, description, and help html for a plugin... the help can be
    stored in the directory with the plugin, methinks.
    <br><br>
    I could extend <code>SimpleHelpBroker</code> to include a button or
    menu or something for installed plugins helps.  But make it generalized
    so it could be re-used for other apps..hmm..

    <a name="dsedit"><font size="+1">Datastream Editor API</font></a>
    <br><br>
    [talk about datastream editor api]
    <br><br>
    The idea is that you can add an internal editor to take care of editing
    data of certain mime types.  The editors will go in a standard place
    an probably follow something like (or exactly) the plugin interface.
    They'll also say what mime types they can edit or view, and whether
    they can only edit, only view, or both. They'll have access to internal
    variables so they can write their data, and they'll follow some kind
    of callback interface so when the app closes or the associated object
    is saved, etc, they'll know and can save automatically or bring up
    some kind of modal dialog or something.
