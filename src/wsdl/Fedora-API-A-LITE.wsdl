<!-- Description:  Fedora API-A-LITE is a  URI-oriented service definition that is intended to support a REST style binding to the Fedora Access web service (in contrast to a traditional SOAP web service binding).  This means that we define a simple URL syntax that can be used to issue service requests to the Fedora Access service. API-A-Lite does not provide service bindings for all of the operations defined in the complete Fedora Access web service (see Fedora-API-A).  API-A-Lite only provides bindings for GetDissemination and GetObjectProfile.  The result of the GetDissemination request is a MIME-typed stream.  The result of the GetObjectProfile request is either HTML or XML, whichever the client requested. The main purpose of defining API-A-Lite is to provide a simple way to run Fedora disseminations via a URL. -->

				<documentation>  This URL replacement syntax is used to request the object profile.
					When putting together a proper URL, the client should replace parenthesized
					parts of the operation location URL with actual values.  For example, "(PID)" 
					should be replaced with an actual PID of an object for which the client wants 
					to get information about (e.g. uva-lib:10).	Parts of the operation location URL that
					are surrounded by brackets ("[ ]") are optional.  To construct a proper URL the
					client must replace the following variables with real information:
						- PID : a required parameter. Client must provide the persistent identifier of the object.
					 	- DATETIME : an optional parameter.  Client can specifiy a dateTime value 
					 	  indicating that the client wants the object profile to reflect how the object looked 
					 	  as of a particular date and time.   (NOT implemented in release 1.0.)
					 	- ENCODE_XML : an optional parameter.  Client can specify that the output of 
					 	  the operation be HTML or XML.   A value of "yes" indicates a return type of 
					 	  text/xml; the absence of the ENCODE_XML parameter or a value of "no" indicates 
					 	  format is to be text/html.

				<documentation>  This URL replacement syntax is used to request a dissemination of the object.
					When putting together a proper URL, the client should replace parenthesized
					parts of the operation location URL with actual values.  For example, "(PID)" 
					should be replaced with an actual PID of an object that the client wants to request a
					dissemination of (for example a PID value of "uva-lib:10").  Those parts of the operation

						  method to be executed.  A behavior method is also known as a dissemination method.

						  must begin with a question mark to delimit it from the rest of the URL.  Then, the
						  parameters follow as a set of name/value pairs separated by ampersands. 
						  Each name and value is connected by an equal sign. This is in accordance with normal
						  URL syntax for encoding parameters.
