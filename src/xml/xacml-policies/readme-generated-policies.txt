[this readme-generated-policies.txt file is copied by ant build.xml into the 
directory for generated policies]

This directory is reserved for repository-wide policies which are programmatically-generated,
e.g., by Fedora Policy Tool.  The program which created any policies in this directory
likely will treat them as write-only, i.e., any persistent storage which it uses
to edit these policies will be different from the copies in this directory.
So any hand-edit changes could be lost on the next machine re-creation.

Bottomline:  consider carefully what you're doing before hand-editing these policies!
