  /** Datastream Control Group:
   *  This indicates the nature of the repository's control over the
   *  datastream content.  Values are:
   *  <p>
   *  FIXME: I don't think type "P" is a type anymore...Protected or not
   *  is controlled at the repository level, and both use "E".  Also,
   *  "R" is a type... it means redirect (for streams)...right? - Chris
   *  </p>
   *  P = Protected-ExternalRef.  The datastream content is external to
   *      to the repository and referenced by a URL.  The content is not
   *      under the direct custodianship of the repository.  However,
   *      the datastream content is protected by the repository.
   *      The repository will not reveal the underlying location of the
   *      datastream content and will mediate all access to the content
   *      by collaborating services (e.g., a behavior mechanism service).
   *  E = ExternalRef.  The datastream content is external to the repository
   *      and referenced by URL.  The content is not under the direct
   *      custodianship of the repository.  The URL is considered public
   *      so the repository does not worry about whether it exposes the
   *      datastream location to collaborating services.
   *  M = Managed-Internal.  The datastream content is stored and managed
   *      by the repository.  The content is considered under the direct
   *      custodianship of the repository.  The repository does not expose
   *      the underlying storage location to collaborating services and
   *      it mediates all access to the content by collaborating services.
   *  X = Inline-XML-User-Metadata.  The datastream content is user-defined
   *      XML metadata that is stored within the digital object XML file itself.
   *      As such, it is intrinsically bound to the digital object, and by
   *      implication, it is stored and managed by the repository.  The content
   *      considered under the custodianship of the repository.
