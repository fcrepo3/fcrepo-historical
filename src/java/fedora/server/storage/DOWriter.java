/**
 * The standard interface for write operations on a digital object.
 * <p></p>
 * A <code>DOWriter</code> instance is a handle on a Fedora digital object,
 * and is obtained via a <code>getWriter(String)</code> call on a 
 * <code>DOManager</code>.
 * <p></p>
 * This interface supports transaction behavior with the commit(String) and
 * rollBack() methods.  When a DOWriter is instantiated, there is an implicit
 * transaction.  Write methods may be called, but they won't affect the
 * the underlying data store until commit(String) is invoked.  This also has
 * the effect of creating another implicit transaction.  If temporary
 * changes are no longer wanted, rollBack() may be called to return the object 
 * to it's original form.  rollBack() is only valid for the current transaction.
 * <p></p>
 * The read methods of DOWriter reflect on the composition of the object in
 * the context of the current transaction.
