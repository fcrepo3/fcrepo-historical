     * When a DOManager provides a DOWriter, it creates two kinds of
     * locks.  One, the object lock, is created permanently.  This
     * is the lock that guarantees no other user can make a modification
     * to the object until the locking user is done making a change.  This is
     * a persistent lock in that it remains even after the system is
     * shutdown or the DOWriter object is garbage collected.
     * <p></p>
     * The other kind of lock is more temporary.  It's called a session lock.
     * This is used to guarantee that the same user can't get more than one
     * handle (DOWriter) on the same underlying object.  To release the
     * session lock, a DOWriter user calls this method.
