 * <p><b>Description:</b> Interface for a converter of TableSpec objects to
 * RDBMS-specific DDL code.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this class must be thread-safe.  That is, one
 * instance can be used simultanously without problems.  This typically
 * just means that no varying fields should be used.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations must also have a public no-arg constructor.</p>
