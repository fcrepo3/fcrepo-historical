        The Fedora repository provides access to data objects by leveraging tools and services
        that are described by the behavior objects. These services can exist as services on a
        remote host or they can also be included as part of the Fedora repository. Services
        that are under the custodianship of the Fedora repository are referred to as
        <em>Local Services.</em> The Fedora repository comes bundled with three local services.
