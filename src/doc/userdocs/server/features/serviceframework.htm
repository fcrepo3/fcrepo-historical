<h2><a name="INTRO"></a>1&nbsp; Introduction</h2>
<p><font style="font-size: 9pt" face="Arial">As of Fedora 2.1, the<a href="serviceframework.htm"> 
Fedora Service Framework</a> is being introduced to facilitate the integration 
of new services with the Fedora repository. <font style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp; 
The framework takes a service-oriented architecture approach to building new 
functionality around a Fedora repository.&nbsp; While the Fedora repository, 
itself, exposes its functionality as a set of web service interfaces, all of 
these interfaces belong to the Fedora web application that runs in its own 
Tomcat&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Fedora Service Framework allows new services to be 
built around the core repository - <i>as stand-alone web applications that run 
independently of the Fedora repository.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; While Fedora repository 
functionality can still be extended with new modules, the intent is to keep the 
repository service focused on the core functions of a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Yet, there are many other services that are beneficial companions to a 
repository, such as specialized ingest services, workflow services, preservation 
services, and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the kinds of services that the 
framework is intended to support.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two main benefits to the 
service framework approach:&nbsp; (1) it allows new functionality to be added as</font> 
atomic, modular services that can interact with Fedora repositories, yet not be 
part of the repository, (2) it makes co-development of new services for Fedora 
easier since each service can be independently developed and plugged&nbsp; into 
the framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of Fedora 2.1, the Fedora development team has 
released an initial 
set of services (<a href="../../services/diringest-service.html">Directory Ingest</a> and
<a href="../../services/oaiprovider-service.html">OAI Provider </a>described below), and will continue 
to develop new services over the coarse of Fedora Phase 2 (2005-2007), especially 
services for workflow, preservation, and search.&nbsp;&nbsp; Services that are 
part of the framework will 
be packaged as part of the Fedora open-source software distribution and will be kept up to date with new 
versions of the core Fedora repository service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the 
Fedora community will be collaborating on the development of services and will 
contributed back to the Fedora Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further documentation 
will be provided to establish guidelines on how services should be designed to 
effectively plug into the framework.&nbsp; In the mean time, developers of new 
services can follow the design patterns of the Directory Ingest and OAI Provider 
services. </font></p>

<h2><a name="FRAMEWORK1">2 </a>&nbsp; The Fedora Service Framework (2005-2007)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fedora Service Framework, establishes a means for coupling new services with 
the core Fedora repository service.&nbsp; The framework allows for the creation of 
atomic, modular services that can interact with the Fedora repository or each 
other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagram below depicts the Fedora Service Framework 
as it is envision to evolve during 2005-2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first two services introduced with Fedora 2.1 
are depicted in orange: the OAI Provider and the Directory Ingest services.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
During Phase 2 of the Fedora Project (2005-2007), both 
the Fedora development team, and the Fedora community will develop the other 
services to fit into the framework.&nbsp; The Fedora Search and Workflow 
services are planned for Fedora 2.2 (estimated early Q3 2006).</p>

<p>The Fedora Service Framework can evolve to include new services conceived of 
by the Fedora community. &nbsp;&nbsp; Listed below 
is a brief description of each service, links to specifications when available, 
and status. </p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="../../services/oaiprovider-service.html">OAI Provider</a>
	</b>(Fedora 2.1):&nbsp; a configurable OAI Provider service for harvesting 
	metadata out of a Fedora repository via OAI-PMH.&nbsp; The service can be 
	configured to harvest any type datastream of dissemination from objects in 
	the repository.&nbsp; It also supports OAI sets.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b><a href="../../services/diringest-service.html">Directory Ingest</a>
	</b>(Fedora 2.1):&nbsp; a service to ingest a hierarchical directory of 
	files into a Fedora repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; The service will accept a 
	Submission Information Package (SIP) in the form of a .zip archive that 
	contains directories of files along with a METS-based manifest file that 
	describes the directory hierarchy.&nbsp; The default parent-child 
	relationships that characterize a directory hierarchy can be overridden and 
	refined to have other semantic meaning (e.g., collection-member, 
	folder-document).&nbsp; Upon receipt of the SIP, the Directory Ingest 
	service will process the .zip archive and create a Fedora digital object in 
	the repository for every file and every directory, plus it will record the 
	relationships among them in Fedora's RDF-based relationships datastream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<i>A new web-based client for creating the SIP will be made available in Q2 
	2006.&nbsp; This client will enable a user select files from a file system, 
	add metadata about files, and assert semantically-meaningful relationships, 
	and ultimately submit the SIP to a Fedora repository.&nbsp; </i><br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Search Service</b> (planned for Fedora 2.2):&nbsp; a configurable 
	search service that can index any datastream or dissemination of Fedora 
	digital objects.&nbsp; The service is pluggable, and will provide adapters 
	for Lucene and Zebra as the default backend search engines.&nbsp; Other 
	search adapters can be developed to plug into other engines.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Workflow and Orchestration Service</b> (planned in beta in Q3 2006)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Preservation Integrity Service</b> (currently under specification by 
	Fedora Preservation Working Group)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Preservation Monitoring and Alerting Services </b>(currently under 
	specification by Fedora Preservation Working Group)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Event Notification Service (Publish/Subscribe)</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Persistent Identifier Resolution Service</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Open URL Access Point:</b>&nbsp; an OpenURL interface to a Fedora 
	repository to facilitate cross-repository interoperability as defined 
	by the <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/pathways/">Pathways Project</a> 
	(Cornell/LANL)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Fedora Service Framework provides building blocks for higher-level 
customized services and user applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="REPO"></a>3&nbsp; Fedora Core Repository Service </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of Fedora 2.1, the Fedora Core Repository Service can now be situated 
within the Fedora Service Framework, where a suite of companion services can be 
loosely coupled with the core repository to provide additional functionality 
that is essential to ensuring that the repository can be well-integrated into a 
broader service or application environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fedora repository service was 
developed with the vision that it would to fit into a broader service-based architecture (SOA), and it 
provide web services interfaces to its core functionality.&nbsp; The core 
repository service actually has several web service APIs:&nbsp; an interface for 
repository management (API-M); an interface for repository access (API-A); 
interface for basic repository search; and an interface for RDF-based search of 
the Resource Index.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these web service interfaces are 
available on the Fedora repository server web application that runs in Tomcat.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The repository service is built in a modular manner, so that each inner function 
is implemented as a java-based module.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inner modules are 
configurable, and they can be replaced with alternate implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fedora repository service is the core service in the Fedora Service 
Framework, and was depicted in the above diagram in the center of all other 
services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below, the Fedora 
repository service is depicted in more detail, with its inner modules exposed, 
and all repository interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagram depicts the repository 
service from the perspective of how it maps to the 
<a href="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/">Open Archival Information System (OAIS)</a> reference model which has been approved 
as an ISO standard.</p>
