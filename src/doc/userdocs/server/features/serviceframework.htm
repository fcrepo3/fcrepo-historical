<h2><a name="INTRO"></a>1&nbsp; Introduction</h2>
<p><font style="font-size: 9pt" face="Arial">As of Fedora 2.1b, the<a href="serviceframework.htm"> 
Fedora Service Framework</a> is being introduced to facilitate the integration 
of new services with the Fedora repository. <font style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp; 
The framework takes a service-oriented architecture approach to building new 
functionality around a Fedora repository.&nbsp; While the Fedora repository, 
itself, exposes its functionality as a set of web service interfaces, all of 
these interfaces belong to the Fedora web application that runs in its own 
Tomcat&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Fedora Service Framework allows new services to be 
built around the core repository - <i>as stand-alone web applications that run 
independently of the Fedora repository.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; While Fedora repository 
functionality can still be extended with new modules, the intent is to keep the 
repository service focused on the core functions of a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Yet, there are many other services that are beneficial companions to a 
repository, such as specialized ingest services, workflow services, preservation 
services, and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the kinds of services that the 
framework is intended to support.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two main benefits to the 
service framework approach:&nbsp; (1) it allows new functionality to be added as</font> 
atomic, modular services that can interact with Fedora repositories, yet not be 
part of the repository, (2) it makes co-development of new services for Fedora 
easier since each service can be independently developed and plugged&nbsp; into 
the framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fedora development team has developed an initial 
set of services (Directory Ingest and PROAI described below), and will continue 
to develop new services over the coarse of Fedora Phase 2 (2005-2007), especially 
services for workflow, preservation, and search.&nbsp;&nbsp; New services will 
be part of the main Fedora distribution and will be kept up to date with new 
versions of the core Fedora repository distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the 
Fedora community will be collaborating on the development of services and will 
contributed back to the Fedora Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further documentation 
will be provided to establish guidelines on how services should be designed to 
effectively plug into the framework.&nbsp; In the mean time, developers of new 
services can follow the design patterns of the Directory Ingest and PROAI 
services. </font></p>

<h2><a name="FRAMEWORK1">2 </a>&nbsp; The Fedora Service Framework (2005-2007)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fedora Service Framework, establishes a means for coupling new services with 
the core Fedora repository service.&nbsp; The framework allows for the creation of 
atomic, modular services that can interact with the Fedora repository or each 
other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagram below depicts the Fedora Service Framework 
with the two services introduced with Fedora 2.1b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, both 
the Fedora development team, and the Fedora community will develop new services 
to fit into the framework.&nbsp; As of Fedora 2.1 there are two services that 
are complete:&nbsp; the OAI Provider (PROAI) and the Directory Ingest services.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Fedora Search and Workflow services are planned for Fedora 2.2.&nbsp; Other 
services will be developed in 2006-2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fedora Service Framework can evolve to include new services conceived of 
by the Fedora community. &nbsp;&nbsp; Depicted below 
are services that are already envisioned. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Preservation Integrity Service</li>
	<li>Workflow Service</li>
	<li>Search Service</li>
	<li>Persistent Identifier (PID) Resolution Service</li>
	<li>Preservation Monitoring Service(s)</li>
	<li>Event Notification Service (Publish/Subscribe)</li>
	<li>Open URL Access Point (for cross-repository interoperability as defined 
	by the <a href="http://www.infosci.cornell.edu/pathways/">Pathways Project</a> 
	(Cornell/LANL)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Fedora Service Framework provides building blocks for higher level 
services and user applications.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="REPO"></a>3&nbsp; Fedora Core Repository Service </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of Fedora 2.1, the Fedora Core Repository Service can now be situated 
within the Fedora Service Framework, where a suite of companion services can be 
loosely coupled with the core repository to provide additional functionality 
that is essential to ensuring that the repository can be well integrated into a 
broader service or application environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fedora repository service was 
developed with the vision that it would to fit into a broader service-based architecture (SOA), and it 
provide web services interfaces to its core functionality.&nbsp; The Fedora 
repository service is depicted below from the perspective of how it maps to the 
Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model which has been approved 
as an ISO standard.</p>
