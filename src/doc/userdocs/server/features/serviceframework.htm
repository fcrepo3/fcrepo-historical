<h2><a name="INTRO"></a>1&nbsp; Introduction</h2>
<p><font style="font-size: 9pt" face="Arial">As of Fedora 2.1b, the<a href="serviceframework.htm"> 
Fedora Service Framework</a> is being introduced to facilitate the integration 
of new services with the Fedora repository. <font style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp; 
The framework takes a service-oriented architecture approach to building new 
functionality around a Fedora repository.&nbsp; While the Fedora repository, 
itself, exposes its functionality as a set of web service interfaces, all of 
these interfaces belong to the Fedora web application that runs in its own 
Tomcat&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Fedora Service Framework allows new services to be 
built around the core repository - <i>as stand-alone web applications that run 
independently of the Fedora repository.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; While Fedora repository 
functionality can still be extended with new modules, the intent is to keep the 
repository service focused on the core functions of a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Yet, there are many other services that are beneficial companions to a 
repository, such as specialized ingest services, workflow services, preservation 
services, and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the kinds of services that the 
framework is intended to support.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two main benefits to the 
service framework approach:&nbsp; (1) it allows new functionality to be added as</font> 
atomic, modular services that can interact with Fedora repositories, yet not be 
part of the repository, (2) it makes co-development of new services for Fedora 
easier since each service can be independently developed and plugged&nbsp; into 
the framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fedora development team has developed an initial 
set of services (Directory Ingest and PROAI described below), and will continue 
to develop new services over the coarse of Fedora Phase 2 (205-2007), especially 
services for workflow, preservation, and search.&nbsp;&nbsp; New services will 
be part of the main Fedora distribution and will be kept up to date with new 
versions of the core Fedora repository distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the 
Fedora community will be collaborating on the development of services and will 
contributed back to the Fedora Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further documentation 
will be provided to establish guidelines on how services should be designed to 
effectively plug into the framework.&nbsp; In the mean time, developers of new 
services can follow the design patterns of the Directory Ingest and PROAI 
services. </font></p>

<h2><a name="REPO"></a>2&nbsp; Fedora Repository Server (with Core Repository 
Web Service Interfaces) </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of Fedora 2.1b, the Fedora Service Framework is being introduced to 
facilitate the development of new services to be used in conjunction with the 
Fedora repository service.&nbsp; The Fedora repository service, itself, was 
developed to fit into a broader service-based architecture (SOA), and it 
provides web services interfaces to its core functionality.&nbsp; The Fedora 
repository services is depicted below.</p>

<h2><a name="FRAMEWORK1">2 </a>&nbsp; The Fedora Service Framework </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fedora Service Framework, establishes a means for coupling new services with 
the core Fedora repository.&nbsp; The framework allows for the creation of 
atomic, modular services that can interact with Fedora.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
diagram below depicts the Fedora Service Framework with the two services 
introduced with Fedora 2.1b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, both the Fedora development 
team, and the Fedora community will develop new services to fit into the 
framework.&nbsp; <i><b>&nbsp;</b></i></p>

<h2><a name="FRAMEWORK2">3 Future Services in the Fedora Service Framework 
(2005-2007)</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fedora Service Framework will evolve with new services over the timeframe 
of the current Fedora Phase II project (2005-2007).&nbsp;&nbsp; Depicted below 
are services that are envisioned. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Preservation Integrity Service</li>
	<li>Workflow Service</li>
	<li>Search Service</li>
	<li>PID Resolution Service (for Federations)</li>
	<li>Preservation Monitoring Service</li>
	<li>Event Notification Service (Publish/Subscribe)</li>
	<li>Open URL Access Point</li>
</ul>
