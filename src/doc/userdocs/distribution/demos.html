          This manual describes the demonstration objects that are distributed with 
          the Fedora open-source repository software. These objects can be loaded into 
          the repository in one of two ways. The xml source files can be "ingested" 
          into the repository via the Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command prompt, 
          run: fedora-admin). Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other 
          demos by running the demo load script (from the command prompt, run: fedora-ingest-demos 
          [hostname] [port] [username] [password] [protocol]). The demo object 
          source xml files for the demo objects can be found in the following directory: 
          <strong>[FEDORA_HOME]/client/demo</strong>
          <br />
          <br />          
          <h3>There are two categories of demonstrations:</h3>          
        </span>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Server Demos</strong> - These demos can be run under 
            any conditions. They are intended to work when the Fedora repository 
            server is in a stand-alone condition, for example, if the repository 
            is running without a network connection, or if the repository is 
            behind a firewall and not set up to receive outside connections.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Open Server Demos</strong> - These demos can only be run if 
            the Fedora repository server is running as a network accessible 
            server, meaning that it can make outgoing connections AND accept 
            incoming connections.  If the repository server is running behind a 
            firewall, the firewall must be configured to allow incoming 
            connections on the port that the repository server is running. The 
            Open Server Demos use distributed content and services that are 
            remote to the repository server.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <span class="plaintext">
            Once demo objects are ingested into the repository, they can be viewed via a 
            web browser using API-A-LITE or API-A. Remember the URL syntax to get the object 
            profile via API-A-LITE is : http://{hostname}:{port}/fedora/get/{objectPID}. For 
            example:
            <code class="block">
<pre>http://localhost:8080/fedora/get/demo:5
</pre>

              <li><strong>Simple Document Demo</strong> - This Fedora data object (objectPID is 
              demo:18) demonstrates the simplest Fedora digital object scenario.  
              It is the case where we aggregate content in the Fedora object, and 
              let Fedora's default object behaviors provide access to the content.  
              This is an example of a Fedora digital object that has NO 
              DISSEMINATORS.  In this case, there are 3 datastreams in the object, 
              one for each format of a particular document (in this case the 
              recent Fedora paper presented at ECDL2002).  Since there are no 
              disseminators on the object, we can use the default Fedora object 
              behaviors (the "Default Disseminator" which is identifiable by the 
              behavior definition PID of "fedora-system:3").  The Default 
              Disseminator is dynamically associated with every object in the 
              repository.  Its behavior methods are on every object and include 
              the ability to list items in the object, get an item, get the 
              dissemination index, get Dublin Core record, and other information 
              about the object.  The results of these methods can be returned as 
              either HTML (method names begin with "view...") or XML (method names 
              begin with "get...").   The end result in that the object is simply 
              a container for content and metadata.  The user can view the 
              contents and get any item from the object.  While this scenario may 
              be easy to implement and useful, it does not take advantage of 
              Fedora's extensible behavior model where custom behaviors can be 
              associated with the object.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Simple Image Demo</strong> - The Fedora data object (objectPID is 
              demo:5) demonstrates the UVA Simple Image behaviors by associating a 
              simple disseminator with the object. There are 4 datastreams in the 
              object, one for each of four different image resolutions.  The 
              object has one disseminator that is subscribes to the "UVA Simple 
              Image" behavior definition and uses the Fedora HTTP Image Getter 
              service (behavior mechanism).  Four behavior methods are available 
              (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  The 
              fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the Fedora HTTP Image 
              Getter resolving the URL of the appropriate datastream for each of 
              the UVA Simple Image behaviors.  There are no transformations 
              performed on the datastreams.  This object shows how a behavior 
              definition can be used to create a normalized set of methods for a 
              particular type of object, in this case image objects.  The idea 
              here, is that the Simple Image behavior definition provides a 
              standard set of dissemination methods that can be used on any image 
              object that subscribes to the Simple Image behavior definition.  As 
              we will see later, different variants of image objects can subscribe 
              to the same behavior definition, and is some cases the datastreams 
              will be dynamically transformed by a service to provide the 
              appropriate image disseminations.  This demo shows a simple 
              one-to-one mapping of the datastreams in the object to the behavior 
              methods.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Document Transformation Demo</strong> - The Fedora data object 
              (objectPID is demo:14) demonstrates the Document Transformation 
              behaviors.  There are 3 datastreams in the object, one XML source 
              document, and two XSLT stylesheets.  The object has one disseminator 
              that is associated with the "Document Transform" behavior definition 
              and the Fedora Local Saxon Service (behavior mechanism).  Two 
              behaviors are available (getDocumentStyle1 and getDocumentStyle2).  
              When these methods are run as disseminations, the repository 
              mediates access to the Fedora Local Saxon Service to produce the 
              appropriate transformation on the XML source in the object.  The 
              dissemination result will be one of two document styles.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Image Collection Demo</strong> - This demo illustrates the use of the Resource Index search service 
              to fulfill collection behaviors. <em>For this demo to work, the 
              <a href="../server/resourceIndex/index.html">Resource Index 
              module</a> must be enabled prior to ingesting these objects.</em>
              <br />
              <br />
              A series of data objects (demo:SmileyBucket, demo:SmileyKeychain, 
              etc.) subscribe to the image behaviors defined by the bDef object 
              demo:DualResImage.  Each of these image objects also use the 
              RELS-EXT datastream to assert its membership in the 
              demo:SmileyStuff collection.  The demo:SmileyStuff collection 
              subscribes to bDef object demo:Collection, which defines two 
              methods: list and view.  The collection object uses the 
              demo:DualResImageCollection bMech to implement those behaviors.
              <br />
              <br />
              To see the dynamic HTML listing of collection members in action, 
              you can view http://hostname/fedora/get/demo:SmileyStuff/demo:Collection/view
              <br />
              <br />
              This dissemination first requests the list of members of the demo:SmileyStuff collection using the local 
              <a href="../server/webservices/risearch/index.html">risearch 
              service</a>.  Then it uses the local <a href="../server/localservices/saxon/index.html">saxon service</a> to transform
              the XML results into a human-readable HTML page.  The query text and 
              the stylesheet are both datastreams of the SmileyStuff collection 
              and act as inputs to the list and view behaviors, respectively.

            These can be run in two ways.  The xml source files can be "ingested" into the repository via the Fedora Admin GUI client (from the command prompt, run: fedora-admin).  Otherwise, they can be loaded with all other demos by running the demo load script (from the command prompt, run: fedora-ingest-demos [hostname] [port] [username] [password]).

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Simple Image Demos</strong> - These Fedora data objects (objectPIDs 
              are demo:6 and demo:7) demonstrate the UVA Simple Image behaviors 
              by associating more complex disseminators with the objects. They 
              also demonstrate how two objects with different kinds of 
              datastreams can be made to fulfill the UVA Simple Image behavior 
              contract.  The key thing to note here is that both the demo:6 and 
              demo:7 objects have a disseminator that subscribes to the UVA 
              Simple Image behavior definition.  However, they each use a 
              different service (behavior mechanism) to fulfill the behavior 
              contract.   In the case of demo:7, we have an object with 4 image 
              datastreams, one for each of four different image resolutions.  
              In this object the  UVA ImageZoomer service is used to add value 
              to the image datastreams at runtime.  When a behavior method is 
              run, the UVA ImageZoomer service will be called upon the wrap the 
              image in a Java applet that provides a standardized, zoomable 
              viewer for the images.  No matter which UVA Simple Image behavior 
              is run (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, getThumbnail), the 
              applet is provided.  In the case of demo:6, we have an object 
              with one image datastream, a wavelet-encoded MrSID file.  The 
              object has one disseminator that is subscribes to the "UVA Simple 
              Image" behavior definition and uses the UVA MrSID Service 
              (behavior mechanism).  Again, the same four behavior methods are 
              available (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  
              This time, fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the use 
              of the MrSID service to derive the appropriate image resolution 
              out of the MrSID file.  Another notable feature of the demo:6 
              object is that it shows how XML metadata can be put in the object 
              as datastreams too.  The XML metadata datastreams can be viewed 
              via the Default Disseminator (run getItemIndex or viewItemIndex).  
              A final important point about these demos is that the behavior 
              mechanism services run remote from the repository.  Both the UVA 
              ImageZoomer service and the UVA MrSID Service run as web services 
              at University of Virginia.  These demonstrations show how Fedora 
              objects can leverage distributed web services, and most 
              importantly, now the Fedora repository system handles the 
              mediation and binding to these services in a manner that is 
              transparent to the user.
              <br/>
              <br />
              The Fedora data object (objectPID is demo:30) demonstrates the 
              UVA Simple Image behaviors by associating a simple disseminator 
              with the object.   There are 4 datastreams in the object, one for 
              each of four different image resolutions.  The object has one 
              disseminator that is subscribes to the "UVA Simple Image" 
              behavior definition and uses the Fedora HTTP Image Getter service 
              (behavior mechanism).  Four behavior methods are available 
              (getVeryHigh, getHigh, getMedium, and getThumbnail).  The 
              fulfillment of the behavior contract entails the Fedora HTTP 
              Image Getter resolving the URL of the appropriate datastream for 
              each of the UVA Simple Image behaviors.  There are no 
              transformations performed on the datastreams.  This object is 
              almost identical to the Fedora object (objectPID of demo:5) 
              created under the local-server-demos. The major distinction is 
              that the datastreams for this object are of type "R" indicating 
              that their external URLs are to be redirected by Fedora.  The 
              Fedora server typically protects the true location of external 
              datastreams by functioning as a proxy service, thereby not 
              exposing the physical datastream locations stored in the Fedora 
              objects. However, there are certain situations where users may 
              not want Fedora to proxy the location of external datastreams. 
              For example, streaming audio and video providers may provide 
              special optimization and performance tuning designed to function 
              with a direct connection between a web browser and the content 
              provider. Another example is datastreams that are protected by 
              HTTP Basic authentication. Fedora will provide its own 
              authentication and access policy in a future release to handle 
              access restrictions. In the interim, the redirected datastream 
              type can be used to access external datastreams that are 
              protected with Basic authentication. In the Fedora object in this  
              example, all 4 datastreams are protected on  the external web 
              server using HTTP Basic authentication which requires a username 
              and password in order to access the datastreams. When attempting 
              to execute the disseminations for these datastreams, you will be 
              prompted for a username and password. The required username and 
              password is "fedora".
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><strong>Userinput Image Demos</strong> - These Fedora data objects 
              (objectPIDs are demo:10 and demo:11) demonstrate the UVA 
              Userinput Image behaviors by associating a more complex 
              disseminator with the objects.  The UVA Userinput Image behavior 
              definition was constructed as a demonstration to show how a 
              behavior definition can allow for user input parameters at run 
              time.  In this case, the behavior definition has two methods 
              (getThumbnail and getImage).  The getImage method takes two user 
              input parameters:  the size of the image (e.g., small, medium1, 
              medium2) and whether to wrap the image in a zoomable applet (yes, 
              no).   Both objects share this behavior definition and both use 
              the same the UVA MrSID service.  Depending on what the user 
              enters, the MrSID Service will derive the proper size of the 
              image, and wrap it with a zoomable applet if the user requested.  
              The UVA MrSID Service runs as web services at University of 
              Virginia.  As with the Open Server Simple Image Demos, these 
              demonstrations show how Fedora object can leverage distributed 
              web services.
