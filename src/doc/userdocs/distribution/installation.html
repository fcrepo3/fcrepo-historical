<h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This is the installation guide for Fedora. It includes instructions for 
installing the server and client distributions, as well as instructions for 
installing and compiling the complete source code distribution.</p>

    <div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="intro.prereq">A. Install Prerequisites</a></h3>
    	<p>Required:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 5.0. <br /> 
        	Whether installing a binary or source distribution, JDK 5.0 is 
        	required. 
        	The JDK should be installed on the machine you intend to use as the 
        	Fedora server. The JDK is available from 
        	<a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>.</li>
        </ul>

		<p>Optional:</p>
        <ul>
			<li>Database<br /> 
			The Fedora server is backed in part by a relational database. 
			To simplify installation, the Fedora installer includes and can
			configure an embedded instance of the 
			<a href="http://mckoi.com/database/">McKoi SQL Database 1.0.3</a>. 
			Fedora also supports <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, 
			<a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle 9</a> and 
			<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. 
			If the included McKoi database will not be used, another database 
			server must be installed, configured and running before proceeding 
			with the installation.
			To configure Fedora to use another database, please see the 
			<a href="#database">Database</a> section below for further 
			instructions.</li>
            <li>Servlet Container<br />
            The Fedora installer includes Tomcat 5.0.28. Optionally, Fedora may 
            be installed into any existing servlet container that implements 
            Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 or higher. At this time, Fedora has chiefly 
            been tested with Tomcat 5.0.28 but users have reported running 
            Fedora successfully with Tomcat 5.5.x and Jetty.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additional requirements for building Fedora from source:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Ant 1.6.5 or later<br /> 
        	Fedora uses Ant for its build environment. Ant is available from 
        	<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="intro.download">B. Download Fedora</a></h3>
		<p>The latest version of the software can always be found at
		<a href="http://www.fedora.info/download/" 
		target="_top">http://www.fedora.info/download/</a>.</p>

		<p>There are two download options: the Fedora Installer and the source 
		code distribution. Unless you wish to build Fedora from source, you 
		should select the Fedora Installer.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="intro.env">C. Prepare Environment Variables</a></h3>
		<p>The following environment variables must be correctly defined:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JAVA_HOME
				<p>This should point to the base directory of your Java 
				installation. On Windows systems, this might be C:\java.
				For UNIX derivatives, this might be something like 
				/usr/local/java-1.5.0-sun</p>
			</li>
			<li>FEDORA_HOME
				<p>This is the directory where Fedora will be installed,
				for example, C:\fedora or /usr/local/fedora.</p>
			</li>
			<li>PATH
				<p>This must include the Java and Fedora bin directories. 
				For UNIX derivatives, this will be $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin, 
				$FEDORA_HOME/client/bin and usually $JAVA_HOME/bin.
				For Windows, this will be %FEDORA_HOME%\server\bin, 
				%FEDORA_HOME%\client\bin and usually %JAVA_HOME%\bin.</p>
				<p>If you will be building from source, Ant should also also be
				on your path.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2><a name="installer">2. Installation</a></h2>
	<p>The Fedora Installer provides three installation options: quick, custom, 
	and client.</p>

	<p>To start the installer, change to the directory where you downloaded the 
	installer and at a command prompt, enter</p>
	<div class="code">java -jar fedora-2.2-installer.jar</div>
	
    <div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="installer.quick">A. Quick</a></h3>
		<p>The quick option is designed to get Fedora up and running as quickly 
		as possible, with a minimum of advanced options. 
		The quick install will automatically install a servlet container and 
		database.
		Neither SSL support nor XACML policy enforcement is enabled by the 
		quick install.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="installer.custom">B. Custom</a></h3>
		<p>The custom option provides the most flexibility in configuring an 
		installation. Installation choices include the servlet container,
		database, the host and ports Fedora will be running on, as well as 
		security options including SSL and XACML policy enforcement.</p>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Servlet Container</dt>
			<dd>The installer will automatically configure and deploy to Tomcat 5.0.x 
		and 5.5.x servlet containers. Other servlet containers will require 
		manual deployment of the Fedora web application. The installer will 
		copy the WAR files to FEDORA_HOME/install.</dd>
		
			<dt>SSL</dt>
			<dd>Configuring SSL support for Fedora's API-M interface is strongly 
		recommended. If the Tomcat servlet container is selected, the installer 
		will configure server.xml accordingly. Please consult your servlet 
		container's documentation for certificate generation and installation. 
		(In particular, the example certificate provided by the installer for
		Tomcat should not be used in a production environment).</dd>
		</dl>
	</div>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="installer.client">C. Client</a></h3>
		<p>Both the quick and custom options will install the Fedora client 
		software in addition to the Fedora server. The client option, however, 
		will install only the Fedora client software.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="installer.source">D. Source</a></h3>
		<p>After unpacking the source distribution, change into the newly 
		extracted directory. To build the installer, at a command prompt, 
		enter</p>
		<div class="code">ant installer</div>
		<p>To see a list of build targets, at a command prompt, enter</p>
		<div class="code">ant -projecthelp</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2><a name="running">3. Running Fedora</a></h2>
	<p>If you selected the quick install option, you will find Tomcat 
	installed in FEDORA_HOME/tomcat. To run Fedora, start Tomcat by entering</p>
	<div class="code">$FEDORA_HOME/tomcat/bin/startup.sh</div> 
	<p>(or for Windows)</p> 
	<div class="code">%FEDORA_HOME%\tomcat\bin\startup.bat</div>

	<p>If you selected the custom install option, ensure that your database 
	server is running (unless you selected the embedded McKoi option) and start 
	your servlet container.</p>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="running.demo">A. Demo Objects</a></h3>
		<p>blah blah</p>
		
		<p>If you have changed the values of either <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerHost</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>fedoraServerPort</em></span>, 
	then you must run the <i><b>demo object converter utility </b></i>script to 
	change the host and/or port in the demo object ingest files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	demo object conversion is only required if you are ingesting demo objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	If the demo objects are already ingested into the repository, they will be 
	fine!&nbsp; The 
	demo objects are shipped with references to &quot;localhost:8080&quot; and these 
	references must reflect the new values of <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerHost</em></span> and <span class="emphasis">
	<em>fedoraServerPort</em></span> .&nbsp; Refer to the 
	<a href=
          "../client/cmd-line/index.html" target=
          "_top">Command-line Utilities documentation</a> for additional details 
          on running the demo object converter.</p>
    <p>If you've just got your Fedora server up and running, it's a
    good idea to check out the demonstration objects to get an idea
    of how Fedora works. See <a href="demos.html" target="_top">the
    Demo Manual</a> for complete descriptions of the demos.</p>

    <p>The demos may be ingested via the Fedora Admin GUI tool or
    from the command line. If you ingest the from the Admin GUI,
    you must be sure to ingest bdef objects first, then bmech
    objects, then regular objects.</p>

    <p>To access the Admin GUI use the command:</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-admin [hostname] [port]
    [username] [password]</em></span></p>

    <p>To ingest the demos from the command line (recommended), use
    the command:</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-ingest-demos [hostname]
    [port] [username] [password] [protocol]</em></span></p>

    <p>For additional information on the fedora-ingest-demos command,
    see the documentation for the <a href="../client/cmd-line/index.html#indemo">
    client command-line utilities</a>. Please note that 
    the demo objects must be ingested before they can be discovered 
    using the default search interface.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="running.logs">B. Server Logs</a></h3>
		<p>While the server is running, it writes logs to
    	FEDORA_HOME/server/logs. These are timestamped files, written
    	in a simple XML format. You can use these logs to get more
    	extensive information about what the server is doing or to
    	diagnose problems.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2><a name="database">5. Database</a></h2>
	<p>Fedora is designed to be RDBMS-independent. Fedora has been tested with 
	McKoi, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL. The embedded version of McKoi included 
	with the installer is provided as a convenience. Large repositories or 
	repositories concerned with scalability and performance should consider 
	using an alternative database. If you choose to use any database other 
	than the embedded McKoi provided by the Fedora Installer, we assume here 
	that the database is already installed.</p>

	<p>Follow the instructions below for the RDBMS of your choice in order to 
	create the user and tables required by Fedora.</p>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="intro.env">A. MySQL</a></h3>
		<p>Please note that the MySQL JDBC driver provided by the installer 
		requires MySQL v3.23.x or higher.</p>
		
		<p>Create the database. For example, to create a database named 
		<code>fedora22</code>, enter:</p>
		<div class="code">CREATE DATABASE fedora22;</div>
		
		<p>Set username, password and permissions for the database.
		For example, to set the permissions for user 
		<code>fedoraAdmin</code> with password <code>fedoraAdmin</code> on 
		database <code>fedora22</code>, enter:</p>
		<div class="code">GRANT ALL ON fedora22.* TO fedoraAdmin@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fedoraAdmin';
GRANT ALL ON fedora22.* to fedoraAdmin@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'fedoraAdmin';</div>

		<p>MySQL 4.1.x users must also specify the default character set for the 
		Fedora database as "utf8" and the default collation as "utf8_bin". 
		For example, to set the default character set and collation on a 
		database named "fedora22", enter:</p>
		<div class="code">ALTER DATABASE fedora22 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;
ALTER DATABASE fedora22 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_bin;</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="intro.env">B. Oracle</a></h3>
		<p>With Oracle, you will need to use an administrative account to 
		manually create 1) the Fedora user on the database, and 2) the 
		tablespace on which that user has complete control.</p>
		
		<p>Due to distribution license restrictions, the Fedora Installer does 
		not include the Oracle JDBC driver. Oracle JDBC drivers are available
		from <a href="http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html"
		target="_top">http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html</a>.
        The installer will prompt you for the location of the driver on your 
        filesystem.</p>

	<div class="subsect">
		<h3><a name="intro.env">D. Other Databases</a></h3>
        <p>To use a database other than McKoi, MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL, 
        the database must support common SQL-92 syntax and you must a have a 
        JDBC version 3 driver available.</p>
        
        <p>The JDBC driver will need to be installed manually. For most 
        containers, the driver may be placed in the Fedora webapp's WEB-INF/lib 
        directory. For Tomcat 5.0.x, however, the driver should be installed to 
        TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib. The JDBC url will need to be configured 
        appropriately in the Fedora Server Configuration File.</p>

        <p>Upon startup, Fedora checks the database for all required tables. If 
        the tables do not exist, Fedora will them. Because table creation is 
        much less standardized task across RDBMSs than SQL queries you must do
        one of the following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Create the tables and indexes and auto-increments yourself in 
			your own database (see the file:
			src/dbspec/server/fedora/server/storage/resources/DefaultDOManager.dbspec
			in the source distribution for the RDBMS-neutral table 
			specifications).</li>

            <li>Write a subclass of fedora.utilities.DDLConverter for your 
            database software, include it in the Fedora WEB-INF/classes 
            directory or in a jar file in the Fedora WEB-INF/lib directory, and 
            associate it with the JDBC driver inside the 
            FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg file
			(see how it's done by looking at the MySQLDDLConverter and 
			McKoiDDLConverter associations with their respective drivers in the 
			fedora.fcfg file, and the classes' implementations in the source
 			distribution).</li>
		</ol>

        <p>If you choose option #2, please tell us about it, as it will be 
        useful for other users of Fedora! Option 2 is harder, but it will make 
        future installations of new versions of Fedora (where the db schema will 
        likely change) much easier for you if you plan on using that database
        later.</p>

<div class="sect">
<h2><a name="running">6. Configuring the Fedora Server</a></h2>
	<p>The Fedora Server's configuration is chiefly governed by the Fedora
	Server Configuration File (fedora.fcfg) located at 
	FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg.</p>
	
	<p>The Fedora server configuration file contains: (1) global parameters 
	for the Fedora server, (2) configuration parameters for each server 
	module, and configuration parameters for each persistent data store of 
	the Fedora server.</p>

	<p>The configuration file has a simple schema. It starts with a server 
	element, under which a series of parameter elements occur, followed by a 
	series of module elements, followed by a series of datastore elements. 
	The parameter elements directly following the root server element are used 
	to control what are considered generic server functionality. 
	Examples include the level of logging to do, and the port on which the 
	server is exposed.</p>

	<p>The module elements are used to configure specific parts
        of Fedora. For instance, the module with the role
        attribute, "fedora.server.search.FieldSearch" is used to
        configure the field-searching component of the server.
        Inside the module element, several param elements are
        included. These are specific to that module's
        implementation. Descriptions of each parameter can
        currently be found in the configuration file itself.
        Important ones will be listed below.</p>

	<p>The datastore elements are used to configure various
        databases that might be used by the system. Although the
        sample configuration file holds several, you will typically
        only need one. The datastore elements are associated with
        the modules by means of a parameter inside the associated
        module. In the sample configuration file, for example, the
        poolNames param of the
        fedora.server.storage.ConnectionPoolManager module refers
        to one of the datastore elements in its value.</p>
        
	<p>There are many other parameters you can configure with Fedora. See the 
        Fedora Server Configuration File itself (fedora.fcfg) for internal documentation on all the parameters.</p>
