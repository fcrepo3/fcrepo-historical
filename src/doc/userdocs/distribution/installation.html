      <p>There are multiple distribution packages in a release. The

            <p>If you're in Unix, you must change the permissions
            of the files in the server/bin directory so that you
            can execute them. For instance, if you installed in
            /usr/local, this can be done with the command

            is unpacked into C:\fedora-2.2\server\, go to C:\ and
            unpack the client from there. It will go into

          <li>
            <p>If the machine you're installing on doesn't have a

            example, C:\ or /usr/local. Then unpack the archive in
            that directory. It will create its own directory, named
            according to the version... like fedora-2.2. This will

            don't already have Ant installed, or you have a version
            before v1.6.2, you can use the version that comes with
            the Fedora source distribution in under
            %FEDORA_DEV%\res\apache-ant-1.6.2\bin (in Windows) or
            $FEDORA_DEV/res/apache-ant-1.6.2/bin (in Unix). IMPORTANT: If you
            use your own version of Ant, be sure it's v1.6.2+ or
            the build may not work. You can verify this by typing
            "ant -version" at the command prompt. Note: If you opt
            to use the ant binaries included with the source, and
            you're in Unix, be sure to change the permissions on
            the files in the bin directory so that you can execute
            ant. This can be done with the command: <span class=

      distribution will be put in $FEDORA_DEV/dist</p>

      <p>If you want to run the server and client straight from
      where it was compiled, be sure to set your FEDORA_HOME to
      $FEDORA_DEV/dist, and add $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin and
      $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin to your PATH environment
      variable.</p>

      <p>For other targets, see the build.xml file or type ant
      -projecthelp for a brief description of each.</p>

      <p>To erase all temporary and compiled files created by a
      build, first ensure that your database and Fedora server are
      stopped, and type ant clean. If you're not using McKoi, you
      should also drop the fedora21 (or whatever you named it)
      database from your RDBMS if you want to start fresh.</p>

      <p>Fedora is designed to be RDBMS-independent, but comes with
      a pure java database called McKoi. It has been tested and
      works with McKoi, MySQL and Oracle 9i. If you choose to use
      any database but McKoi, we assume here that it is already
      installed.</p>

      <p>Follow the below instructions for the RDBMS of your choice

              set the default character set to "utf8" and the default
              collation to "utf8_bin" for the Fedora database. Any value 
              may be used for this parameter. If present, the script will

        <p>Note: This command resolves to a batch file
        (mysql-config.bat) in Windows, and a shell script
        (mysql-config.sh) in Unix. These reside in the server's bin
        directory.</p>

        
      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span> Fedora comes installed 
        with version 5.0.4 of the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver that is compatible

        should use all lower case characters when specifiying the
        Fedora database name when running the mysql-config.bat
        script (e.g., "myfedoradb" instead of "MyFedoraDb").
        <!-- Additional information regarding the use of earlier

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>With Oracle 9i, you will need to use an administrative
        account to manually create 1) the fedora user on the db,
        and 2) the tablespace on which that user has complete
        control.</p>

        <p>Then you'll need to make sure the Fedora server has the
        JDBC driver necessary to connect to the database. You can
        download the appropriate Oracle JDBC driver from <a href=
        "http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html"
           target=
           "_top">http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html</a>.
           This will come with a file called <span class=
           "emphasis"><em>ojdbc14.jar</em></span>. You will need to
           put that file on your Fedora server, in the directory:
           <span class=
           "emphasis"><em>FEDORA_HOME/server/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib</em></span>.</p>

        <p>Then you should modify the
        Fedora Server Configuration File (FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg) and ensure that
        the datastore entry (near the bottom) for Oracle points to
        the right host and database. The fedora.fcfg file that
        comes with the distribution uses a database on the local host named "fedora21".</p>

        <p>When you start fedora, be sure to use the parameter
        "oracle", as in <span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-start
        oracle</em></span>. Starting the server is more fully
        explained later.</p>

        </div>

        <p>If you want to use a different database, it's an option,
        but it will take some extra work. Here's how it can be
        done:</p>

            <li>
              <p>The database needs to be JDBC-compliant and must
              support common SQL-92 syntax. The driver will need to
              be put in the server's jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib directory
              so that Fedora picks it up, and the JDBC url will
              need to be configured appropriately in the Fedora Server 
				Configuration File.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Upon startup, Fedora checks the database for all
        required tables. If they don't exist, it creates them.
        Creation of tables is a much less standardized task across
        RDBMSs than regular SQL queries. Thus, you must either</p>

        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>create the tables and indexes and auto-increments
              yourself in your own database (see the file:
              src/dbspec/server/fedora/server/storage/resources/DefaultDOManager.dbspec
              in the source distribution for the RDBMS-neutral
              table specifications),</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>write your own subclass of
              fedora.utilities.DDLConverter for your database
              software, include it in a jar file in
              server/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/common/lib, and associate it with the
              JDBC driver inside the server/config/fedora.fcfg file
              (see how it's done by looking at the
              MySQLDDLConverter and McKoiDDLConverter associations
              with their respective drivers in the fedora.fcfg
              file, and the classes' implementations in the source
              distribution).</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <p>If you choose option #2, please tell us about it, as it
        will be useful for other users of Fedora! Option 2 is
        harder, but it will make future installations of new
        versions of Fedora (where the db schema will likely change)
        much easier for you if you plan on using that database
        later.</p>

		the Fedora Server</h2>
		<h4 class="title"><a name="setup"></a>&nbsp;1. STEP ONE:&nbsp; Run the 
		Fedora Setup Utility to establish your base security settings!</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
	
	  <p>Beginning with Fedora 2.1, the method of configuring the server has changed. 
      Before starting for the first time, you must run the
		<a href="../server/cmd-line/index.html#setup">Fedora Setup Utility </a>
		(fedora-setup) to select a base security 
      configuration and initialize the server with your base configuration using 
      the <i>fedora-setup</i> command-line utility. This process is described 
      in detail in the <i><a href="../server/security/securingrepo.html#CONFIG">Securing 
      Your Repository</a></i> document. Once fedora-setup has been run you can 
      then customize the generated configuration files as needed.</p>

            
     <h4 class="title"><a name="config"></a>2. STEP TWO:&nbsp; Edit the Fedora Server 
     Configuration File (fedora.fcfg) to override default settings.</h4>

        <p>The Fedora server configuration file contains: (1) global parameters 
		for the Fedora server, (2) configuration parameters for each server 
		module, and configuration parameters for each persistent data store of 
		the Fedora server.&nbsp;&nbsp; The configuration file is located at FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg.</p>
		<p>The configuration file has a simple schema.&nbsp; It starts
        with a server element, under which a series of parameter
        elements occur, followed by a series of module elements,
        followed by a series of datastore elements.&nbsp; The parameter elements directly following the root server
        element are used to control what are considered generic
        server functionality. Examples include the level of logging
        to do, the port on which the server should be exposed, and
        the superuser password.</p>

        <p>The module elements are used to configure specific parts
        of Fedora. For instance, the module with the role
        attribute, "fedora.server.search.FieldSearch" is used to
        configure the field-searching component of the server.
        Inside the module element, several param elements are
        included. These are specific to that module's
        implementation. Descriptions of each parameter can
        currently be found in the configuration file itself.
        Important ones will be listed below.</p>

        <p>The datastore elements are used to configure various
        databases that might be used by the system. Although the
        sample configuration file holds several, you will typically
        only need one. The datastore elements are associated with
        the modules by means of a parameter inside the associated
        module. In the sample configuration file, for example, the
        poolNames param of the
        fedora.server.storage.ConnectionPoolManager module refers
        to one of the datastore elements in it's value.</p>

      <p>You will probably want to change the values of the following parameters 
        for you own installation. Items in <span class="bold"><b>bold</b></span> 
        <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be changed prior to running the server 
        for the first time. Other items may require changes depending on your 
        environment. For instance, object_store_base should be changed if you're 
        running the server in Unix, as the default value is windows-specific. 
        All configurable items are described in detail in the fedora.fcfg file. 
        Parameters that are new or that have changed since Fedora 2.0 are highligted

			A directory where XACML policies generated by the future Policy 
              Tool GUI will be stored. This will be created if it doesn't already 
              exist. This parameter must be given as an absolute path. The default

              This should be a short string consisting of the characters [a-z][0-9] 
              and the hyphen ("-") character. When objects are first ingested 
              or created in the repository, this will be the first part of the 
              identifier used for them. (Note: the pid namespace won't be used

              PID actually exists in the object. This option provides a way to 
              override that behavior on a per-pid-namespace basis. If specified, 
              this should be a space-delimited list of pid namespaces that will 
              be accepted in the object as-is. By default, this list includes 
              the namespaces of "test" and "demo".</p>

      <p>The configuration file, fedora.fcfg, can be written so
      that it takes a parameter which has the effect of using an
      alternate value for some of the &lt;param...&gt; elements, if
      an alternate parameter exists. The default fedora.fcfg
      assumes that you're using MySQL, but has been written to use
      the mckoi database if you start it with:</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-start
      mckoi</em></span></p>

      <p>...so if you're using mckoi, start it with the above
      command instead.</p>

      <p>Read the fedora.fcfg file and look for the attributes
      named "mckoivalue" to see how this is done, if you're curious
      or would like to define your own parameter. You can also
      change the fedora.fcfg so that it doesn't have to take the
      "mckoi" parameter in order to run with mckoi (simply set the

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The Fedora server now has internal support for avoiding
    breakage of self-referential URLs (i.e., URLs that contain the
    hostname and port of the Fedora server itself). This change
    allows the Fedora server host and port to be re-configured
    without breaking digital objects that contained URLs that
    referred to a previous host and port configuration.</p>

    <p>The host name and port number on which the Fedora server
    runs is controlled by the <span class=
    "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerHost</em></span> and <span class=
    "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerPort</em></span> parameters in the
    fedora.fcfg configuration file. By default, these are set to
    the host name of <span class=
    "emphasis"><em>localhost</em></span> and port number of
    <span class="emphasis"><em>8080</em></span>. The steps you need
    to take in order to change host name and/or port number vary
    slightly depending on whether you are making the change for the
    first time or making the change on a pre-existing Fedora
    server.</p>

    <p>If you are installing Fedora for the first time, or if you are changing 
	the host or port on an existing Fedora installation, you need to make the 
	following configuration changes:</p>

		<br/>
		a.&nbsp; <i>Fedora's Backend Services Security Configuration</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Since custom disseminators typically use an external services to 
		transform digital object content,&nbsp; these &quot;backend&quot; services must be 
		configured to communicate securely with the Fedora repository server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please consult the instructions found in
		<a href="../server/security/beSecurityConfig.html">Backend Services 
		Security Configuration</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document will tell 
		you how to use Fedora's&nbsp; web interface for 
		backend service configuration.&nbsp; From the web form, you will enter the IP address of the 
		server host for all of the following backend service entries:&nbsp; (1)
		<i>&quot;fedoraInternalCall-1&quot;&nbsp; (2) &quot;fedoraInternalCall-2&quot;&nbsp; and (3)
		</i>the services installed alongside the Fedora repository (on the same 
		machine) to support the Fedora demo objects.&nbsp; Note that all of 
		these service entries are pre-configured with the loopback IP address of 127.0.0.1 
		and your job is to simply add the fixed IP address of your server for 
		each backend service entry that already contains the loopback IP 
		address.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>
		<br/>
		b.&nbsp; <i>Default XACML Policies:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also essential 
		that you add your server's fixed IP address to the default XACML 
		policies that ship with Fedora.&nbsp; Defaul policies are found in the 
		/default subdirectory of the repository-policies you configured in the 
		Authorization module for the server.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The specific

		deny-apim-if-not-localhost.xml, (2) 
		deny-reloadPolicies-if-not-localhost.xml, and (3) deny-serverShutdown-if-not-localhost.xml</i>).&nbsp; 
		If you edit the policy xml file, you will see the loopback IP address of 
		127.0.0.1 in the policy condition.&nbsp; Simply add another entry below 
		this with your fixed IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on 
		these policies, see&nbsp;

          "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerHost</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>fedoraServerPort</em></span>, 
	then you must run the <i><b>demo object converter utility </b></i>script to 
	change the host and/or port in the demo object ingest files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	demo object conversion is only required if you are ingesting demo objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	If the demo objects are already ingested into the repository, they will be 
	fine!&nbsp; The 
	demo objects are shipped with references to &quot;localhost:8080&quot; and these 
	references must reflect the new values of <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>fedoraServerHost</em></span> and <span class="emphasis">
	<em>fedoraServerPort</em></span> .&nbsp; Refer to the 
	<a href=
          "../client/cmd-line/index.html" target=
          "_top">Command-line Utilities documentation</a> for additional details 
          on running the demo object converter.</p>

    <p>While the server is running, it writes logs to
    FEDORA_HOME/server/logs. These are timestamped files, written
    in a simple XML format. You can use these logs to get more
    extensive information about what the server is doing or to
    diagnose problems.</p>

    <p>If you've just got your Fedora server up and running, it's a
    good idea to check out the demonstration objects to get an idea
    of how Fedora works. See <a href="demos.html" target="_top">the
    Demo Manual</a> for complete descriptions of the demos.</p>

    <p>The demos may be ingested via the Fedora Admin GUI tool or
    from the command line. If you ingest the from the Admin GUI,
    you must be sure to ingest bdef objects first, then bmech
    objects, then regular objects.</p>

    <p>To access the Admin GUI use the command:</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-admin [hostname] [port]
    [username] [password]</em></span></p>

    <p>To ingest the demos from the command line (recommended), use
    the command:</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-ingest-demos [hostname]
    [port] [username] [password] [protocol]</em></span></p>

    <p>For additional information on the fedora-ingest-demos command,
    see the documentation for the <a href="../client/cmd-line/index.html#indemo">
    client command-line utilities</a>. Please note that 
    the demo objects must be ingested before they can be discovered 
    using the default search interface.</p>
