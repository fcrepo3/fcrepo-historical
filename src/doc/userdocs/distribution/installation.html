It includes instructions for installing the server and client distributions, as well as instructions for installing and compiling the complete source code distribution.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e56"></a>Install Prerequisite Software</h3></div></div><p>Required:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
						<span class="emphasis"><em>Sun's Java Software Development Kit, v1.4.</em></span>  Whether you are installing a binary or source distribution, you must have the J2SDK v1.4 or above. It should be installed on the machine you intend to use as the Fedora server.  You can download it at <a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/</a>
					</p></li></ul></div><p>Optional:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
						<span class="emphasis"><em>MySQL, v3.23.x, MySQL 4.x, or Oracle 9i</em></span>  
						The Fedora server is backed in part by a relational database.  
						If you decide not to use the included pure java database, McKoi v0.94 
						(more about that later), you should download and install 
						one of the known, working databases for your platform 
						(or see the "Other Databases" section below).  
						You can download MySQL at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_top">http://www.mysql.com/</a>.  (Please note that issues have been reported when using older versions of the Windows implementation of MySQL v3.23.53 - v3.23.58 with Fedora.  For running under Windows, we recommend using the current production version of MySQL for Windows.  For more information on using earlier versions of MySQL, please see <a href="http://www.fedora.info/wiki/bin/view/Fedora/PoolWasntFoundMessage" target="_top">this page on the Fedora wiki.</a>)

			</p><p>	There are multiple distribution packages in a release.  The server binaries, the client binaries, and the entire source code.  Each of these packages is distributed in .tar.gz (for Unix) and .zip (for Windows) archives.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e96"></a>Unpack Fedora</h3></div></div><p>Server binary distribution:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Decide where you want the Fedora software to reside.  For example, C:\ or /usr/local.</p></li><li><p>Unpack the archive in that directory.  It will create its own directory, named according to the version... like fedora-1.2.1.  This will be the home directory of Fedora.</p></li><li><p>If you're in Unix, you must change the permissions of the files in the server/bin directory so that you can execute them.

					</p></li></ul></div><p>Client binary distribution:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If a server is already unpacked on the machine, put the client in the same place.  That is, if your server is unpacked into C:\fedora-1.2.1\server\, go to C:\ and unpack the client from there.  It will go into C:\fedora-1.2.1\client, so that now both the client and server are under one common directory.</p></li><li><p>If the machine you're installing on doesn't have a server, decide where you want the client to reside.  For example, C:\ or /usr/local.  Then unpack the archive in that directory.  It will create its own directory, named according to the version... like fedora-1.2.1.  This will be the home directory of Fedora.</p></li><li><p>If you're in Unix, you must change the permissions of the files in the client/bin directory so that you can execute them.  For instance, if you installed in /usr/local, this can be done with the command <span class="emphasis"><em>chmod 755 /usr/local/fedora-1.2.1/client/bin/*</em></span>
					</p></li></ul></div><p>Source Code:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Decide where you want to work with the source code and unpack it there.

							<span class="emphasis"><em>Note for server and client installations: If you would rather not set your JAVA_HOME to point to the version required by Fedora (for instance, if you run other applications using java1.3) you can instead set the FEDORA_JAVA_HOME environment variable.  This way, Fedora's java installation won't conflict with your other java applications.</em></span>
						</p><p>Note for source installations: JAVA_HOME must be set to the values stated above, since ant requires this environment variable.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>PATH must contain the executable (bin) directory of the J2SDK installation.  This is usally just under JAVA_HOME.</p></li></ul></div><p>For server and client installations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>FEDORA_HOME must point to the base directory of your Fedora installation.  You will choose this directory when you unpack a binary distribution.</p></li></ul></div><p>For server installations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PATH must contain the executable directory of the Fedora server software installation.  This will be $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin on Unix, or %FEDORA_HOME%\server\bin in Windows.</p></li></ul></div><p>For client installations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PATH must contain the executable directory of the Fedora client software installation.

For instance, if you installed the source in C:\ and it unpacked into C:\fedora-src-1.2.1\, FEDORA_DEV should be C:\fedora-src-1.2.1</p></li><li><p>PATH should contain the bin directory of Ant.  If you don't already have Ant installed, or you have a version before v1.4.1, you can use the version that comes with the Fedora source distribution in under %FEDORA_DEV%\res\ant\bin (in Windows) or $FEDORA_DEV/res/ant/bin (in Unix).  IMPORTANT: If you use your own version of Ant, be sure it's v1.4.1+ or the build may not work. You can verify this by typing "ant -version" at the command prompt.  Note: If you opt to use the ant binaries included with the source, and you're in Unix, be sure to change the permissions on the files in the bin directory so that you can execute ant.  This can be done with the command: <span class="emphasis"><em>chmod 755 $FEDORA_DEV/res/ant/bin/*</em></span>

					<span class="emphasis"><em>ant serverdist</em></span>
				</p></blockquote><p>and everything necessary for a server and client distribution will be put in $FEDORA_DEV/dist</p><p>If you want to run the server and client straight from where it was compiled, be sure to set your FEDORA_HOME to $FEDORA_DEV/dist, and add $FEDORA_HOME/server/bin and $FEDORA_HOME/client/bin to your PATH environment variable.</p><p>For other targets, see the build.xml file or type ant -projecthelp for a brief description of each.</p><p>To erase all temporary and compiled files created by a build, first ensure that your database and Fedora server are stopped, and type ant clean.  If you're not using McKoi, you should also drop the fedora12 (or whatever you named it) database from your RDBMS if you want to start fresh.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e207"></a>Setting up the Server</h2></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e210"></a>Initialize the Database</h3></div></div><p>Fedora is designed to be RDBMS-independent, but comes with a pure java database called McKoi.  It has been tested and works with McKoi, MySQL and Oracle 9i.  
			If you choose to use any database but McKoi, we assume here that it is already installed.</p><p>Follow the below instructions for the RDBMS of your choice in order to create the user and tablespace so that the Fedora software can use the database.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e217"></a>McKoi</h4></div></div><p>Execute the command:</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>mckoi-init <span class="emphasis"><em>fedoraDBUser fedoraDBPass</em></span>
					</p></blockquote><p>...where the first parameter is the username you'd like to use for the database, and the second parameter is the password you'd like to use.  Remember this information, as it will be needed later when configuring Fedora.</p><p>Username and password values are case sensitive.</p><p>Note: This command resolves to a batch file (mckoi-init.bat) in Windows, and a shell script (mckoi-init.sh) in Unix.  These reside in the server's bin directory.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e234"></a>MySQL</h4></div></div><p>Execute the command:</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>mysql-config <span class="emphasis"><em>installDir dbaUser dbaPass fedoraDBUser fedoraDBPass dbName</em></span>
					</p></blockquote><p>Where:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
							<span class="emphasis"><em>installDir</em></span> is the location where MySQL is installed.  In Unix, this might be /usr/local/mysql.  In Windows, it might be C:\mysql</p></li><li><p>
							<span class="emphasis"><em>dbaUser</em></span> is the name of the MySQL user with dba privileges.  In a default MySQL installation, this will be root.</p><p>Please note that dbaUser is case sensitive.</p></li><li><p>
							<span class="emphasis"><em>dbaPass</em></span> is the password of the MySQL user with dba privileges.  In a default MySQL installation,  if you're running MySQL on the same machine as Fedora, you can usually pass "" for this argument.</p><p>Please note that dbaPass is case sensitive.</p></li><li><p>

(e.g., fedora12) Please note that the user name is case sensitive.</p></li></ul></div><p>Note: This command resolves to a batch file (mysql-config.bat) in Windows, and a shell script (mysql-config.sh) in Unix.  These reside in the server's bin directory.</p><p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span> Fedora comes installed with a JDBC driver that works with MySQL v3.23.x. 
				If you wish to use MySQL 4.*, you must replace that driver.  Detailed instructions
				can be found <a href="http://www.fedora.info/wiki/bin/view/Fedora/MySQLVersion4" target="_top">on this page of the Fedora wiki</a>.
				</p><p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span> If you are installing Fedora under Windows and plan to use an earlier version of MYSQL (e.g., 3.23.53 thru 3.23.58), you should use all lower case characters when specifiying the Fedora database name when running the mysql-config.bat script (e.g., "myfedoradb" instead of "MyFedoraDb"). Additional information regarding the use of earlier versions of Windows MYSQL can be found <a href="http://www.fedora.info/wiki/bin/view/Fedora/PoolWasntFoundMessage" target="_top">on this page of the Fedora wiki</a>.
				</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e306"></a>Oracle 9i</h4></div></div><p>With Oracle 9i, you will need to use an administrative
				account to manually create 1) the fedora user on the db, and
				2) the tablespace on which that user has complete control.</p><p>Then you'll need to make sure the Fedora server
				has the JDBC driver necessary to connect to the database.
				You can download the appropriate Oracle JDBC driver from
				<a href="http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html" target="_top">
http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html</a>.
                This will come with a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>ojdbc14.jar</em></span>.
				You will need to put that file on your Fedora server, in the
				directory: <span class="emphasis"><em>FEDORA_HOME/server/tomcat41/common/lib</em></span>.
                </p><p>Then you should modify the FEDORA_HOME/server/config/fedora.fcfg file
				and ensure that the datastore entry (near the bottom) for Oracle
				points to the right host and database.  The fedora.fcfg file
				that comes with the distribution uses a database on the local host
				called "fedora12".
                </p><p>When you start fedora, be sure to use the parameter "oracle", as in
				<span class="emphasis"><em>fedora-start oracle</em></span>.  Starting the server is more
				fully explained later.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e329"></a>Other Databases</h4></div></div><p>If you want to use a different database, it's an option, but it will take some extra work.  Here's how it can be done:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The database needs to be JDBC-compliant and must support common SQL-92 syntax.  The driver will need to be put in the server's tomcat41/common/lib directory so that Fedora picks it up, and the JDBC url will need to be configured appropriately in the server's config/fedora.fcfg file.</p></li></ul></div><p>	Upon startup, Fedora checks the database for all required tables.  If they don't exist, it creates them.  Creation of tables is a much less standardized task across RDBMSs than regular SQL queries.  Thus, you must either</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>create the tables and indexes and auto-increments yourself in your own database (see the file: src/dbspec/server/fedora/server/storage/resources/DefaultDOManager.dbspec in the source distribution for the RDBMS-neutral table specifications),</p></li><li><p>write your own subclass of fedora.utilities.DDLConverter for your database software, include it in a jar file in server/tomcat41/common/lib, and associate it with the JDBC driver inside the server/config/fedora.fcfg file (see how it's done by looking at the MySQLDDLConverter and McKoiDDLConverter associations with their respective drivers in the fedora.fcfg file, and the classes' implementations in the source distribution).</p></li></ol></div><p>If you choose option #2, please tell us about it, as it will be useful for other users of Fedora!  Option 2 is harder, but it will make future installations of new versions of Fedora (where the db schema will likely change) much easier for you if you plan on using that database later.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e349"></a>Modify Fedora's Configuration</h3></div></div><p>Before starting for the first time, you will want to make some changes in Fedora's main configuration file, server/config/fedora.fcfg.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e354"></a>Introducing fedora.fcfg</h4></div></div><p>The configuration file has a simple schema.  It starts with a server element, under which a series of param elements occur, followed by a series of module elements, followed by a series of datastore elements.</p><p>The param elements directly following the root server element are used to control what are considered generic server functionality.  Examples include the level of logging to do, the port on which the server should be exposed, and the superuser password.</p><p>The module elements are used to configure specific parts of Fedora.  For instance, the module with the role attribute, &#8220;fedora.server.search.FieldSearch&#8221;  is used to configure the field-searching component of the server.  Inside the module element, several param elements are included.  These are specific to that module&#8217;s implementation.  Descriptions of each parameter can currently be found in the configuration file itself.  Important ones will be listed below.</p><p>The datastore elements are used to configure various databases that might be used by the system.  Although the sample configuration file holds several, you will typically only need one.  The datastore elements are associated with the modules by means of a parameter inside the associated module.  In the sample configuration file, for example, the poolNames param of the fedora.server.storage.ConnectionPoolManager module refers to one of the datastore elements in it&#8217;s value.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e365"></a>Important Parameters</h4></div></div><p>You will probably want to change the values of the following parameters for you own installation.  Items in <span class="bold"><b>bold</b></span>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be changed prior to running the server for the first time.  Other items may require changes depending on your environment.  
				For instance, object_store_base should be changed if you're running the server in Unix, as the default value is windows-specific.  All configurable items are described in detail in the fedora.fcfg file.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">adminPassword</span></dt><dd><p>This is where you set the value of the administrative user, &#8220;fedoraAdmin&#8221;&#8217;s password.

Port conflicts can arise if you are running multiple instances of a tomcat or Fedora server on the same machine. Fedora uses the default shutdown port number of 8005. If you are running other standalone instances of tomcat or Fedora on the same machine, each instance will require a unique shutdown port. This parameter allows you to change the port number used to shutdown the Fedora server to avoid potential port conflicts with other servers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">fedoraRedirectPort</span></dt><dd><p>The port on which the server is redirected. Port conflicts can arise if you are running multiple instances of a tomcat or Fedora server on the same machine. Fedora uses the default redirect port number of 8443. If you are running other standalone instances of tomcat or Fedora on the same machine, each instance will require a unique redirect port. This parameter allows you to change the port number used to redirect the Fedora server to avoid potential port conflicts with other servers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">

It is controlled through the boolean parameter named doMediateDatastreams in the fedora.fcfg configuration file. By default, the value of the doMediateDatastreams parameter is set to false which disables datastream mediation. The following section describes the advantages and disadvantages of using Datastream Mediation.</p><p>Content is stored in Fedora digital objects as one or more datastreams. Each datastream contains a pointer to the physical location of its content. For Referenced External Content and Redirected datastreams, this is a pointer to remote content that is managed outside the custodianship of the repository. For Managed Content and XML Metadata datastreams, this is a pointer to internal content that is managed by the repository.</p><p>An object&#8217;s content is accessed through its disseminators that interact with external mechanisms associated through the disseminator&#8217;s behavior mechanism object. In order for the external mechanisms to function, they must have access to the datastream locations. With Datastream Mediation disabled, Fedora passes the actual physical location of datastreams to external mechanisms as part of the dissemination process. If the external mechanisms are trusted, the risk of exposing the actual datastream locations to these mechanisms may be negligible. However, if the mechanisms are not trusted or reside completely outside the control of the repository administrator, the risk of exposure may be higher. The worst-case scenario would be where an untrusted mechanism captures the actual datastream locations and then accesses the datastreams directly rather than going through the Fedora repository.</p><p>The DatastreamMediation option was added to give Fedora repository administrators more control over how datastream locations are exposed. Using Datastream Mediation does affect the functioning of the repository so the administrator needs to weigh the advantages and disadvantages to determine which option best suits their needs.</p><p>When Datastream Mediation is enabled, it essentially activates an additional layer of proxying within the repository. When dissemination requests are processed, the repository will proxy all datastream requests to the external mechanisms providing an internal reference in place of the actual datastream locations. The external mechanisms then must communicate with the Fedora repository to resolve the proxy requests and receive the contents of the datastream in the form of a bytestream. This additional layer of proxying effectively hides the actual datastream locations from the external mechanisms and insures that Managed Content and XML Metadata datastreams can only be directly accessed through the Fedora repository. Datastream Mediation will also proxy Referenced External Content datastreams, but since these types of datastreams by definition are remotely available on the internet , Fedora cannot guarantee that their actual locations cannot be discovered by other means. Redirected datastreams are never proxied.</p><p>Advantages</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Security &#8211; Datastream Mediation insures that Managed Content and XML Metadata datastreams can only be directly accessed through the Fedora repository. It provides an extra layer of security if you have external mechanisms that may not be trusted or desire to maintain tighter control over the exposure of datastream locations.</p></li></ul></div><p>Disadvantages</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Performance &#8211; Datastream Mediation adds an additional layer of proxying. It does degrade performance slightly since it adds one more network hop necessary to resolve a datastream location by the external mechanism.</p></li><li><p>Firewall Issues &#8211; If your Fedora repository is installed behind a network security firewall, Datastream Mediation will not function unless you have configured the firewall to allow access to the Fedora repository port number (default is port 8080).  This is because external mechanisms must make HTTP read requests to the Fedora repository over the server&#8217;s port number to resolve the datastream locations. If you have ready access to the firewall&#8217;s configuration, this may be an easy task to accomplish. If your firewall is provided by a 3rd party, then accomplishing the necessary configuration may be more difficult or may even not be possible. </p></li></ul></div><p>Ultimately, it is up to the Fedora repository administrator to decide if Datastream Mediation should be used. Here are some sample scenarios to provide some additional guidance. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Scenario 1 &#8211; Consider a Fedora repository where all objects use Managed Content datastreams and the administrator has no control over external mechanisms. The administrator also wants to insure that the only access to Fedora datastreams is through the repository. In this scenario, the Fedora administrator will want to enable Datastream Mediation since the repository manages all the datastreams and also wants tight control over how datastreams may potentially be accessed.</p></li><li><p>Scenario 2 &#8211; Consider a Fedora repository where all objects use Referenced External Content datastreams and some mechanisms may be untrusted. Since all datastreams are Referenced External Content, their actual locations could be discovered through alternate means on the web. In this scenario, the administrator may want to disable Datastream Mediation since it does not offer a significant improvement in controlling datastream location exposure since all of the datastreams in the repository are remote content.</p></li><li><p>Scenario 3 &#8211; Consider a Fedora repository where objects use a mix of datastreams and all external mechanisms are untrusted. In this scenario, the administrator might decide to enable or disable Datastream Mediation depending on the percentage of remote datastreams versus Managed Content datastreams and on the importantance controlling datastream exposure.</p></li><li><p>Scenario 4 &#8211; Consider a Fedora repository where all objects use Managed Content datastrams and the administrator has no control over external mechanisms. The Fedora repository is also behind a firewall and the administrator cannot alter the firewall configuration. The administrator has no choice in this scenario and must disable Datastream Mediation for the repository to function.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e608"></a>Other Settings</h4></div></div><p>There are many other parameters you can configure with Fedora.

            The default fedora.fcfg assumes that you're using MySQL, but

            instead.</p><p>Read the fedora.fcfg file and look for the attributes
            named "mckoivalue" to see how this is done, if you're curious
            or would like to define your own parameter.  You can also change
            the fedora.fcfg so that it doesn't have to take the "mckoi" parameter
