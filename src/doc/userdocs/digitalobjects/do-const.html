Briefly, the Fedora object model consists of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
					<span class="bold"><b>PID</b></span> - a persistent, unique identifier for the object</p></li><li><p>
					<span class="bold"><b>Datastream(s)</b></span> &#8211;  the component in a Fedora object that represents MIME-typed content.  An object can have one or more Datastreams. The content of a Datastream can be either data or metadata, and this content can either be stored internally in the Fedora repository, or stored remotely (in which case Fedora holds a pointer to the content in the form of a URL).</p></li><li><p>
					<span class="bold"><b>System Metadata</b></span> &#8211; a set of system-defined attributes that are necessary to manage and track the object in the repository.</p></li><li><p>
					<span class="bold"><b>Disseminator(s)</b></span> -  the component in a Fedora object that associates a service with the object for the purpose of transforming or presenting the content represented by Datastreams.  An object can have zero or more Disseminators.  Each Disseminator points to a <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Definition</em></span> and a <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Mechanism</em></span>.  A <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Definition</em></span> defines an abstract set of methods to which the object is said to &#8220;subscribe.&#8221;  A <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Mechanism</em></span> defines the concrete bindings to a service that implements the abstract methods of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Behavior Definition</em></span>. </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e95"></a>Three Types of Fedora Digital Objects</h2></div></div><p>Although every Fedora digital object conforms to the Fedora object model, as described above, there are three distinct types of Fedora digital objects that can be stored in a Fedora repository.   The distinction between these three types is fundamental to how the Fedora repository system works.  Basically, in Fedora, there are objects that store digital content entities, objects that store service descriptions, and objects that store service binding information.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e100"></a>
				<span class="emphasis"><em> Data Objects</em></span>
			</h3></div></div><p>In Fedora, a Data Object is the type of object used to represent a digital content entity.  Data Objects are what we normally think of when we imagine a repository storing digital collections.  Data Objects can represent such varied entities such as images, books, electronic texts, learning objects, publications, datasets, and many other entities.  One or more Datastreams represent the parts of the digital content entity.  One or more Disseminators represent services that can present different views or transformations of the content entity.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e108"></a>
				<span class="emphasis"><em> Behavior Definition Objects </em></span>
			</h3></div></div><p>In Fedora, a Behavior Definition Object is the type of object used to represent an abstract service definition in the form of an abstract set of methods.  This is similar to the notion of an interface in Java.  From the Fedora perspective, a Behavior Definition Object defines a &#8220;behavior contract&#8221; that one or more Data Object may &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to.  A Data Object is said to subscribe to a particular behavior contract when its Disseminator points to the PID of a given Behavior Definition Object.</p><p></p><p>Behavior Definition Objects are stored in the repository just like other Fedora objects.  Although the Fedora repository system is able to identify Behavior Definition Objects as special &#8220;utility&#8221; objects, it stores and manages them just like Fedora Data Objects.   Also, clients can access these objects in the same manner they access Data Objects.</p><p></p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e120"></a>
				<span class="emphasis"><em> Behavior Mechanism Objects</em></span>
			</h3></div></div><p>In Fedora, a Behavior Mechanism Object is the type of object used to represent a concrete service definition.  From the Fedora perspective a Behavior Mechanism Object represents a service that fulfills the requirements of a behavior contract defined by a Behavior Definition.  The combination of a Behavior Definition and Behavior Mechanism constitutes a Disseminator on a Data Object.  Together, they provide the means for associating a set of behaviors with a Fedora Data Object.</p><p></p><p>For a Disseminator to work, a Data Object must be associated with particular service that is  an &#8220;implementation&#8221; of a behavior contract it to which the object &#8220;subscribes.&#8221;  Thus, a Data Object&#8217;s Disseminator not only points to the PID of a given Behavior Definition Object, it also points to the PID of particular Behavior Mechanism Object.</p><p></p><p>A Behavior Mechanism Object stores several forms of metadata that describe a set of methods and the runtime bindings for invoking these methods.  The most significant of these metadata formats is service binding information encoded in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL).  Fedora uses WSDL to &#8220;normalize&#8221; the view of a service.  This enables Fedora to talk to a variety of different services in a predictable and standard manner.   It also contains metadata that defines a &#8220;data contract&#8221; between the service and any object that associates with the service.  The data contract (also known as the &#8220;Datastream Input Specification&#8221;) specifies the kind of datastreams that must be available in the data object to serve as input to the various methods of the service.  Given that a typical use of a service is to transform or present the datastream content of a Data Object, it is necessary to define datastreams as &#8220;input parameters&#8221; to the service methods.</p><p></p><p>Behavior Mechanism Objects are stored in the repository just like other Fedora objects.  Although the Fedora repository system is able to identify Behavior Mechanism Objects as special &#8220;utility&#8221; objects, it stores and manages them just like Fedora Data Objects.   Also, clients can access these objects in the same manner they access Data Objects.</p><p></p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e138"></a>Application Programming Interface for Object Creation (API-M)</h2></div></div><p>Digital object construction is achieved via the methods of the Fedora Management API (API-M).   The Management API exposes methods to ingest objects into the repository, as well as methods to create objects interactively.  For a details description of each of the methods in API-M, see the specification at <a href="http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/" target="_top">http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/api/</a>. The API is also expressed in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and is available at <a href="http://www.fedora.info/documents/Fedora-API-M.wsdl" target="_top">http://www.fedora.info/documents/Fedora-API-M.wsdl</a>

More information on METS can be found at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/" target="_top">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/</a>.   As of Fedora 1.0, the repository will only accept a Fedora-specific extension of the METS 1.0 Schema.  We made a few minor additions to METS 1.0 to accommodate the requirements of Fedora.  In the future, we plan to accept XML submissions encoded to the METS 1.3 Schema, which will have changes that accommodate the few Fedora-specific extensions to METS.   In the mean time, we validate the Fedora Object XML submissions against the Fedora extension of METS which is published at: http://www.fedora.info/definitions/1/0/mets-fedora-ext.xsd.</p><p>Since METS was designed to be very generic and support a variety of uses, the rules of the METS Schema are very general-purpose.  Fedora objects must conform to other rules that are beyond the scope of what is expressed in the METS schema.  Therefore, the Fedora Object XML submissions will also be validated against a set of Fedora-specific rules that are expressed using the Schematron language (link for Schematron).  Internally, the repository will use Schematron to enforce these rules on incoming XML submission packages.  The Schematron rules are expressed in XML and can be found in the Fedora server distribution at:</p><p> %FEDORA_HOME%\dist\server\schematron\fedoraRulesExt.xml. </p><p>For convenience and ease of understanding we have enumerated the Fedora rules in plain English below:</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e319"></a>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Data Object Encoding Rules: </em></span>
			</h3></div></div><p>Encoding by hand requires a pretty good understanding of METS, although it can be done by following the patterns in the demo objects that come with the Fedora distribution.  Demo objects are located at: 	%FEDORA_HOME%\dist\client\demo. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>General attributes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="round"><li><p>a.  On METS root element, the OBJID attribute will represent the Fedora object PID.  Normally, this should be left empty so that the Fedora repository can generate a new PID.   	However,  you can assign test/demo PIDs by inserting a value in OBJID that begins with &#8220;demo:&#8221; or &#8220;test:&#8221; for example, &#8220;demo:100&#8221;</p></li><li><p>b. On METS root element, the value of the TYPE attribute must be &#8220;FedoraObject&#8221; &#8221;</p></li><li><p>c.  On METS root element, the value of LABEL serves as the official description of the object.  If there is no Dublin Core record present in the object, the Fedora repository will use this 	label to populate the title element of a baseline Dublin Core record for the object. </p></li><li><p>d.  On METS root element, the PROFILE element can be used by institutions to classify different types of Fedora data objects. </p></li><li><p>e.  On the METS:metsHdr element the CREATEDATE attribute is optional since the Fedora repository will assign this at ingest time.  However, if a CREATEDATE attribute exists in the 	submission package it must be populated with a date value in the following format:  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.  The same thing goes for LASTMODDATE. </p></li><li><p>f.   On the METS:metsHdr element the RECORDSTATUS should be set to &#8220;I&#8221; to indicate the METS serves as an &#8220;Ingest&#8221; package for Fedora. </p></li><li><p>g.  It is recommended that the METS:agent element be populated with information about the agent responsible for submitting the METS file as a submission format for Fedora to ingest. 	</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Datastreams:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="round"><li><p>a.  To create a proper section for Datastreams in the METS file, the METS:fileSec must have a single child METS:fileSec element whose ID attribute has the value &#8220;DATASTREAMS&#8221; 	</p></li><li><p>b.   Datastreams that are encoded in the METS:fileSec must follow the following pattern to establish proper version groups and datastream IDs.  Each datastream has its own 	METS:fileGrp whose ID attribute is the official datastream ID.  The recommended convention is ID=&#8221;DSn&#8221; where n is a number (for example ID=&#8221;DS1&#8221; or ID=&#8221;DS2).&#8221; </p></li><li><p>c.  Within a METS:fileGrp, there can be one or more METS:file elements to represent different versions of a datastream.  As of Fedora 1.2, versioning of data objects is supported.  The METS:file element for the datastream must have and ID attribute that represent the version number relative to the datastream ID set in the METS:fileGrp.  The recommended convention is ID=&#8221;DSn.v&#8221;  where n is the 	number of the datastream and v is the version number (for example ID=DS1.0 or ID=DS1.1). </p></li><li><p>d. The METS:file element for a datastream must have a CREATED attribute whose value is populated with a date in the following format:        &#8220;YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss&#8221;.  </p></li><li><p>e. The METS:file element for a datastream must have a MIMETYPE. </p></li><li><p>f. The METS:file element for a datastream must have an OWNERID attribute.  In Fedora, the OWNERID attribute is used to encode the Datastream Control Group.  The following are valid 	values: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="square"><li><p>1.  &#8220;M&#8221; &#8211; Managed Content.  This tells the repository to store the datastream&#8217;s content byte stream inside the repository.  When the METS:file contains &#8220;M&#8221; on the OWNERID,  the repository will resolve the URL associated with the METS:file element and pull the content into the repository for permanent storage.  Fedora will establish its own local identifier for retrieving the content, and  disregard the original URL that came in on the METS submission package. </p></li><li><p>2. &#8220;E&#8221;  - External Referenced Content.  This tells the repository to store the URL for the datastream content, not the content byte stream itself.  For this type of datastream, 	Fedora  does not actually manage or have custodianship of the content, but it manages the link to the content and  some basic metadata about it. </p></li><li><p>3.  &#8220;R&#8221; &#8211; Redirected Content.  Like &#8220;E&#8221; this tells the repository to store the URL for the datastream content, not the content byte stream itself.  More importantly, it tells the repository  not to mediate or proxy this content at runtime.  Instead, the repository will redirect to the URL at run time.  This is desirable when a datastream points to a streaming media source, or to a complex web page where  some components are lost during proxying. </p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Inline XML Datastreams:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="round"><li><p>a. Datastreams can also be encoded in the METS:dmdSecFedora and METS:amdSec.  These are considered &#8220;inline XML datastreams&#8221; in Fedora.  The METS:dmdSecFedora and  METS:amdSec elements act as datastream version group containers just like the METS:fileGrp acts for regular datastreams.  Within these elements, the METS &#8220;metadata section&#8221; elements (i.e., METS:techMD,  METS:rightsMD, etc.) are used for the specific version instances of the inline metadata datastreams, just like the METS:file acts for regular datastreams.  The datastream IDs work the same way, where the ID attribute  on the container element acts as the datastream ID, and the ID on the metadata section element acts as the datastream version ID.</p></li><li><p>b. Do not use the schemaLocation attribute in the root element of inline XML datastreams (within METS:mdWrap element).</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Dublin Core Record Datastream:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="round"><li><p>a. A Dublin Core (DC) record is optional in the Fedora object submission package.  If one is not provided the repository will automatically create a minimal DC record in the object by using the LABEL (on METS root) as the DC title element.  It will also use the object PID as the DC identifier element.</p></li><li><p>b.  If a DC record is provided in the METS submission package it should be encoded within a METS:dmdSecFedora.  The dmdSecFedora element will act as the datastream version group 	container.  It MUST have an ID attribute whose value is &#8220;DC&#8221; to be recognized by Fedora!</p></li><li><p>c.  Within the METS:dmdSecFedora, there must be one METS:descMD element.  This element is part of the Fedora extension of METS 1.0 and is used to encode a specific version of the DC datastream within the version group container.  The ID attribute on the METS:descMD element MUST have the value &#8220;DC1.0&#8221; to be recognized by Fedora.</p></li><li><p>d.  The actual DC metadata should be encoded using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Dublin Core schema. </p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Disseminators</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="round"><li><p>a.  Each Disseminator is encoded in its own METS:behaviorSec element.  The METS:behaviorSec element acts as a version container for different versions of the Disseminator.  As of Fedora 1.2.1, only one version is supported.  Each Disseminator must have a disseminator ID which is encode in the ID attribute of the METS:behaviorSec.  The recommended convention is ID=&#8221;DISSn&#8221; where n is a 	number (for example ID=&#8221;DISS1&#8221; or ID=&#8221;DISS2).&#8221;  </p></li><li><p>b.  The METS:serviceBinding element represents a particular version of the disseminator.  Again, in Fedora 1.2.1 only one version is supported.  The element must have and ID attribute that represent the version number relative to the Disseminator ID that is set in the METS:behaviorSec.  The recommended convention is ID=&#8221;DISSn.v&#8221;  where n is the number of the Disseminator and v is the version number (for example ID=DISS1.0 or ID=DISS1.1). </p></li><li><p>c.  The METS:serviceBinding element must have a CREATED attribute whose value is populated with a date in the following format: &#8220;YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss&#8221;. </p></li><li><p>d.  The METS:serviceBinding element must have a STRUCID attribute.  The value of this attribute the ID of a METS:structMap section in the submission package.  The METS:structMap section constitutes the Fedora &#8220;Datastream Binding Map&#8221; which identifies the Datastreams in the object that will be used by the Disseminator.  Specifically, these are the datastreams that fulfill the &#8220;data contract&#8221; 	defined by the Behavior Mechanism Object that is pointed to by the Disseminator.</p></li><li><p>e.  The METS:structMap, in turn, points to Datastreams in the object, and gives them a special name via the TYPE attribute of the METS:structMap.  Again, the METS:structMap encodes the fulfillment of the &#8220;data contract&#8221; that the Behavior Mechanism object specifies so that datastreams can act as input parameters to service methods (described earler). </p></li><li><p>f.  To make a Disseminator point to a Behavior Definition Object (to make the object subscribe to a &#8220;behavior contract&#8221;), there must be a single METS:interfaceMD element as a child to the METS:serviceBinding element.  The METS:interfaceMD element must have a LOCTYPE attribute whose value is &#8220;URN&#8221; and an xlink:href attribute whose value is the PID of a Fedora Behavior Definition Object.</p></li><li><p>g.  To make a Disseminator point to a Behavior Mechanism Object (to associate a particular service that runs a behavior contract&#8217;s methods), there must be a single METS:serviceBindMD element as a child to the METS:serviceBinding element.  The METS: serviceBindMD element must have a LOCTYPE attribute whose value is &#8220;URN&#8221; and an xlink:href attribute whose value is the PID of a Fedora Behavior Mechanism Object.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e436"></a>
