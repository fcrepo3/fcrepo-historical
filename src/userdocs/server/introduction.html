        (Flexible Extensible Digital Object and Repository Architecture) [<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/payette/papers/ECDL98/FEDORA.html" target="_top">view
        paper</a>]. The Fedora architecture was developed by Carl Lagoze
        and Sandy Payette at Cornell University, inspired by ideas of the
        Kahn/Wilensky Framework [<a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/cstr/arch/k-w.html" target="_top">view paper</a>]
        and the Warwick Framework [<a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july96/lagoze/07lagoze.html" target="_top">view paper</a>].</p><p>Since its inception, the architecture has seen multiple
        implementations. Over the last several years, Cornell University and
        The University of Virginia have created promising prototypes of their
        own. This open-source implementation, indended for public release, is
        the result of a collaborative effort between Cornell and UVa. The
        project is funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation.</p><p>More information about the project and its history can be found
        at <a href="http://www.fedora.info/" target="_top">http://www.fedora.info/</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e70"></a>Concepts</h3></div></div><p>A good understanding of the ideas behind Fedora can be gathered
        by reading the <a href="http://www.fedora.info/pubs.shtml" target="_top">related
        publications</a> and the <a href="http://www.fedora.info/techdoc.shtml" target="_top">technical specification</a>.
        Briefly:</p><p>In Fedora, a <span class="emphasis"><em>digital object</em></span> is a data
        structure with a <span class="emphasis"><em>PID</em></span> (a unique, persistent
        identifer), one or more <span class="emphasis"><em>datastreams</em></span> (typed
        sequences of bits), and one or more <span class="emphasis"><em>disseminators.</em></span>
        A disseminator maps an object's datastreams as input to a service,
        enabling the repository to provide disseminations of the object. A
        dissemination is simply a representation of an object.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>behavior mechanism</em></span> represents a service
        that performs functions on datastreams. It is the means by which a
        disseminator binds to a service. A behavior mechanism specifies the
        datastream input constraints of the service it describes. It also
        adheres to a contract that is specified by its behavior definition.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>behavior definition</em></span> specifies the names
        of methods that subscribing mechanisms must implement. It also
        specifies the user parameters that implementing services must accept.
        These are the same user parameters that are used by the disseminating
        party in the request to the Fedora repository.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
