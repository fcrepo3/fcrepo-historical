      The contents of the downloaded file (saxon.zip), with the exception of the 
      &AElig;lfred parser (see below), are subject to the Mozilla Public License 
      Version 1.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except 
      in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at

      Software distributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot; 
      basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the 
      License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under 
      the License.<br />
      The Original Code of SAXON comprises all those components which are not 
      explicitly attributed to other parties. It does not include the &AElig;lfred 
      parser, which is redistributed under the licence described below.<br />
      The Initial Developer of the Original Code was Michael Kay of International 
      Computers Limited. Individual modules identified as being created by James 
      Clark, David Megginson, or John Cowan include separate IPR notices. All 
      Rights Reserved.<br />
      Since February 2001 I (Michael Kay) have been an employee of Software AG, 
      and I continue to develop Saxon with the support and sponsorship of that 
      company. Technically, therefore, the &quot;Initial Developer&quot; no longer 
      exists (the form of words was deliberately chosen to reflect the joint involvement 
      of myself and ICL), so I now work as a &quot;Contributor&quot;. Other contributors 
      are acknowledged individually in comments attached to the relevant code 
      modules. <br />
      iclway is an Internet Service Provider operated by ICL; however, the fact 
      that I continue to use this ISP for hosting Saxon does not imply that ICL 
      have any interest in the content of the site. Equally, for reasons of continuity, 
      I have kept the icl.com domain name in package names and namespace URIs 
      with the tacit consent of ICL, but this should not be taken to imply any 
      ongoing ICL involvement.<br />
      If you produce a product that includes or requires SAXON, please refer to 
      it as &quot;The SAXON XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;, and include 
      the URL of the home page, which is at <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.<br />
      There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able to 
      answer enquiries within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing list 
      available at <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a> 
      and raise any enquiries there. Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge 
      for details of known errors; all bugs are listed there as soon as I have 
      sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.</p>
    <p>&AElig;lfred<br />
      Included in the Saxon distribution is a modified version of the &AElig;lfred 
      XML parser from Microstar. I have taken the relevant part of David Brownell's 
      &AElig;lfred2 distribution, repackaged it, and fixed a few bugs. All cahnges 
      are clearly documented in the source code.<br />
      This is distributed under the terms of Microstar's terms and conditions, 
      which are as follows: <br />

      The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000, 
      modified as follows:<br />
      * Changed the package name to com.icl.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental 
      confusion with the original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.<br />
      * Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute 
      xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end 
      of file occurs prematurely <br />
      * Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and 
      SAX driver, with appropriate changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() 
      methods.<br />
      * Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been 
      incorporated.</p>
    <p>Saxon Servlet<br />
      Included in this distribution is a modified version of the Saxon Servlet 
      Adapted from the SaxonServlet.java example file contained in the source 
      distribution of &quot;The SAXON XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;.</p>

      1. LICENSE TO USE. Sun grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license 
      for the internal use only of the accompanying software and documentation 
      and any error corrections provided by Sun (collectively &quot;Software&quot;), 
      by the number of users and the class of computer hardware for which the 
      corresponding fee has been paid. <br />
      2. RESTRICTIONS. Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to Software 
      and all associated intellectual property rights is retained by Sun and/or 
      its licensors. Except as specifically authorized in any Supplemental License 
      Terms, you may not make copies of Software, other than a single copy of 
      Software for archival purposes. Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable 
      law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer Software. You acknowledge 
      that Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design, 
      construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility. Sun disclaims 
      any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. No right, title 
      or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of 
      Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement. <br />
      3. LIMITED WARRANTY. Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) 
      days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the 
      media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in 
      materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software 
      is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;. Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability 
      under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software 
      media or refund the fee paid for Software. <br />
      4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS 
      OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED 
      WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
      ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
      BE LEGALLY INVALID. <br />
      5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT 
      WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, 
      OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, 
      HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR 
      RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN 
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability 
      to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, 
      exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing 
      limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential 
      purpose. <br />
      6. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate 
      this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software. This Agreement 
      will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply 
      with any provision of this Agreement. Upon Termination, you must destroy 
      all copies of Software. <br />
      7. Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered under this 
      Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be subject to export 
      or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly with 
      all such laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility 
      to obtain such licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required 
      after delivery to you. <br />
      8. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If Software is being acquired by or 
      on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor 
      or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software 
      and accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; 
      this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department 
      of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD 
      acquisitions). <br />
      9. Governing Law. Any action related to this Agreement will be governed 
      by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules 
      of any jurisdiction will apply. <br />
      10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, 
      this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
      omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement 
      will immediately terminate. <br />
      11. Integration. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and 
      Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
      oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties 
      and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
      acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its 
      subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this 
      Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized 
      representative of each party. <br />

      SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS<br />
      These supplemental license terms (&quot;Supplemental Terms&quot;) add to

      the &quot;Agreement&quot;). Capitalized terms not defined in these Supplemental 
      Terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. These 
      Supplemental Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms 
      in the Agreement, or in any license contained within the Software. <br />
      1. Software Internal Use and Development License Grant. Subject to the terms 
      and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to Section 
      3 (Java(TM) Technology Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants 
      you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce internally 
      and use internally the binary form of the Software complete and unmodified 
      for the sole purpose of designing, developing and testing your Java applets 
      and applications intended to run on the Java platform (&quot;Programs&quot;). 
      <br />
      2. License to Distribute Software. In addition to the license granted in 
      Section 1 (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant) of these 
      Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
      including but not limited to Section 3 (Java Technology Restrictions) of 
      these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,

      software intended to replace any component(s) of the Software, (iii) do 
      not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in the 
      Software, (iv) only distribute the Software subject to a license agreement 
      that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained in this 
      Agreement, and (v) agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from

      3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform Interface 
      (&quot;JPI&quot;, identified as classes contained within the &quot;java&quot; 
      package or any subpackages of the &quot;java&quot; package), by creating 
      additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or 
      modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that you create an
